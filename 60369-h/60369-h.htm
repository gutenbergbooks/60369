<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p><span class="figleft100"><img src="images/i_000ac.jpg" width="62" height="80" alt="I" /></span>N the following pages the Author has placed before
the reader an account of the changes in the
design of Decorative Furniture and Woodwork,
from the earliest period of which we have any reliable
or certain record until the present time.</p>

<p>A careful selection of illustrations has been made
from examples of established authenticity, the majority
of which are to be seen, either in the Museums to
which reference is made, or by permission of the owners;
and the representations of the different "interiors" will
convey an idea of the character and disposition of the
Furniture of the periods to which they refer. These
illustrations are arranged, so far as possible, in chronological
order, and the descriptions which accompany them are
explanatory of the historical and social changes which
have influenced the manners and customs, and directly
or indirectly affected the Furniture of different nations.
An endeavour is made to produce a "panorama," which
may prove acceptable to many, who, without wishing to
study the subject deeply, may desire to gain some
information with reference to it generally, or with regard
to some part of it, in which they may feel a particular
interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be obvious that within the limits of a single
volume of moderate dimensions it is impossible to give
more than an outline sketch of many periods of design
and taste which deserve far more consideration than is
here bestowed upon them; the reader is, therefore, asked
to accept the first chapter, which refers to "Ancient
Furniture" and covers a period of several centuries, as
introductory to that which follows, rather than as a serious
attempt to examine the history of the Furniture during
that space of time. The fourth chapter, which deals with
a period of some hundred and fifty years, from the
time of King James the First until that of Chippendale
and his contemporaries, and the last three chapters, are
more fully descriptive than some others, partly because
trustworthy information as to these times is more accessible,
and partly because it is probable that English readers
will feel greater interest in the Furniture of which they
are the subject. The French <em>meubles de luxe</em>, from the
latter half of the seventeenth century until the Revolution,
are also treated more fully than the Furniture of other
periods and countries, on account of the interest which
has been manifested in this description of the cabinet
maker's and metal mounter's work during the past fifteen
or twenty years. There is evidence of this appreciation in
the enormous prices realised at notable auction sales, when
such Furniture has been offered for competition to wealthy
connoisseurs.</p>

<p>In order to gain a more correct idea of the design
of Furniture of different periods, it has been necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
to notice the alterations in architectural styles which
influenced, and were accompanied by, corresponding changes
in the fashion of interior woodwork. Such comments are
made with some diffidence, as it is felt that this branch
of the subject would have received more fitting treatment
by an architect, who was also an antiquary, than by
an antiquary with only a limited knowledge of architecture.</p>

<p>Some works on "Furniture" have taken the word
in its French interpretation, to include everything that
is "movable" in a house; other writers have combined
with historical notes, critical remarks and suggestions as
to the selection of Furniture. The Author has not
presumed to offer any such advice, and has confined his
attention to a description of that which, in its more
restricted sense, is understood as "Decorative Furniture
and Woodwork." For his own information, and in the
pursuit of his business, he has been led to investigate
the causes and the approximate dates of the several
changes in taste which have taken place, and has recorded
them in as simple and readable a story as the difficulties
of the subject permit.</p>

<p>Numerous acts of kindness and co-operation, received
while preparing the work for the Press, have rendered
the task very pleasant; and while the Author has endeavoured
to acknowledge, in a great many instances,
the courtesies received, when noticing the particular occasion
on which such assistance was rendered, he would desire
generally to record his thanks to the owners of historic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
mansions, the officials of our Museums, the Clerks of
City Companies, Librarians, and others, to whom he is
indebted. The views of many able writers who have
trodden the same field of enquiry have been adopted
where they have been confirmed by the writer's experience
or research, and in these cases he hopes he has not
omitted to express his acknowledgments for the use he
has made of them.</p>

<p>The large number of copies subscribed for, accompanied,
as many of the applications have been, by expressions
of goodwill, and confidence beforehand, have been very
gratifying, and have afforded great encouragement during
the preparation of the work.</p>

<p>If the present venture is received in such a way as
to encourage a larger effort, the writer hopes both to
multiply examples and extend the area of his observations.</p>

<h5>BIBLICAL REFERENCES.</h5>

<p><span class="figleft100"><img src="images/i_001b.jpg" width="218" height="300" alt="T" /></span>HE first well-known reference to woodwork is
to be found in the Book of Genesis, in
the instructions given to Noah to make
an Ark of gopher<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> wood, "to make a
window," to "pitch it within and without
with pitch," and to observe definite
measurements. From the specific directions
thus handed down to us, we may
gather that mankind had acquired at a
very early period of the world's history
a knowledge of the different kinds of
wood, and of the use of tools.</p>

<p>We know, too, from the bas-reliefs
and papyri in the British Museum, how
advanced were the Ancient Egyptians in
the arts of civilization, and that the
manufacture of comfortable and even luxurious furniture was not
neglected. In them, the Hebrews must have had excellent workmen for
teachers and taskmasters, to have enabled them to acquire sufficient skill
and experience to carry out such precise instructions as were given for
the erection of the Tabernacle, some 1,500 years before Christ&mdash;as to
the kinds of wood, measurements, ornaments, fastenings ("loops and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
taches"), curtains of linen, and coverings of dried skins. We have only
to turn for a moment to the 25th chapter of Exodus to be convinced
that all the directions there mentioned were given to a people who had
considerable experience in the methods of carrying out work, which must
have resulted from some generations of carpenters, joiners, weavers, dyers,
goldsmiths, and other craftsmen.</p>

<p>A thousand years before Christ, we have those descriptions of the
building and fitting by Solomon of the glorious work of his reign, the
great Temple, and of his own, "the King's house," which gathered from
different countries the most skilful artificers of the time, an event which
marks an era of advance in the knowledge and skill of those who were thus
brought together to do their best work towards carrying out the grand
scheme. It is worth while, too, when we are referring to Old Testament
information bearing upon the subject, to notice some details of furniture
which are given, with their approximate dates as generally accepted,
not because there is any particular importance attached to the precise
chronology of the events concerned, but because, speaking generally, they
form landmarks in the history of furniture. One of these is the verse
(2 Kings chap. iv.) which tells us the contents of the "little chamber
in the wall," when Elisha visited the Shunammite, about <span class="smcapa">B.C.</span> 895; and
we are told of the preparations for the reception of the prophet: "And
let us set for him there a bed and a table and a stool and a
candlestick." Another incident is some 420 years later, when, in the
allusion to the grandeur of the Palace of Ahasuerus, we catch a glimpse
of Eastern magnificence in the description of the drapery which furnished
the apartment: "Where were white, green, and blue hangings, fastened
with cords of fine linen and purple, to silver rings and pillars of marble;
the beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red and blue and
white and black marble." (Esther i. 6.)</p>

<p>There are, unfortunately, no trustworthy descriptions of ancient
Hebrew furniture. The illustrations in Kitto's Bible, Mr. Henry Soltau's
"The Tabernacle, the Priesthood, and the Offerings," and other similar
books, are apparently drawn from imagination, founded on descriptions in
the Old Testament. In these, the "table for shew-bread" is generally
represented as having legs partly turned, with the upper portions square,
to which rings were attached for the poles by which it was carried. As a
nomadic people, their furniture would be but primitive, and we may take it
that as the Jews and Assyrians came from the same stock, and spoke the
same language, such ornamental furniture as there was would, with the
exception of the representations of figures of men or of animals, be of
a similar character.</p>

<p>The discoveries which have been made in the oldest seat of monarchical
government in the world, by such enterprising travellers as Sir Austin
Layard, Mr. George Smith, and others who have thrown so much light
upon domestic life in Nineveh, are full of interest in connection with
this branch of the subject. We learn from these authorities that the
furniture was ornamented with the heads of lions, bulls, and rams; tables
thrones, and couches were made of metal and wood, and probably inlaid
with ivory; the earliest chair, according to Sir Austin Layard, having
been made without a back, and the legs terminating in lion's feet or
bull's hoofs. Some were of gold, others of silver and bronze. On the
monuments of Khorsabad, representations have been discovered of chairs
supported by animals, and by human figures, probably those of prisoners.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
In the British Museum is a bronze throne, found by Sir A. Layard
amidst the ruins of Nimrod's Palace, which shews ability of high order
for skilled metal work.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith, the famous Assyrian excavator and translator of cuniform
inscriptions, has told us in his "Assyrian Antiquities" of his finding close
to the site of Nineveh, portions of a crystal throne somewhat similar in
design to the bronze one mentioned above, and in another part of this
interesting book we have a description of an interior that is useful in
assisting us to form an idea of the condition of houses of a date which
can be correctly assigned to <span class="smcapa">B.C.</span> 860:&mdash;"Altogether in this place I
opened six chambers, all of the same character, the entrances ornamented
by clusters of square pilasters, and recesses in the rooms in the same
style; the walls were colored in horizontal bands of red, green, and
yellow, and where the lower parts of the chambers were panelled with
small stone slabs, the plaster and colours were continued over these."
Then follows a description of the drainage arrangements, and finally we
have Mr. Smith's conclusion that this was a private dwelling for the wives
and families of kings, together with the fact that on the other side of
the bricks he found the legend of Shalmeneser II. (<span class="smcapa">B.C.</span> 860), who probably
built this palace.</p>

<p>In the British Museum is an elaborate piece of carved ivory, with
depressions to hold colored glass, etc., from Nineveh, which once formed
part of the inlaid ornament of a throne, shewing how richly such objects
were ornamented. This carving is said by the authorities to be of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Egyptian origin. The treatment of figures by the Assyrians was more
clumsy and more rigid, and their furniture generally was more massive
than that of the Egyptians.</p>

<p>An ornament often introduced into the designs of thrones and chairs
is a conventional treatment of the tree sacred to Asshur, the Assyrian
Jupiter; the pine cone, another sacred emblem, is also found, sometimes
as in the illustration of the Khorsabad chair on page <a href="#Page_4">4</a>, forming an
ornamental foot, and sometimes being part of the merely decorative
design.</p>

<p>The bronze throne, illustrated on page <a href="#Page_3">3</a>, appears to have been of
sufficient height to require a footstool, and in "Nineveh and its Remains"
these footstools are specially alluded to. "The feet were ornamented, like
those of the chair, with the feet of lions or the hoofs of bulls."</p>

<p>The furniture represented in the following illustration, from a bas-relief
in the British Museum, is said to be of a period some two hundred
years later than the bronze throne and footstool.</p>

<p>In the consideration of ancient Egyptian furniture we find valuable
assistance in the examples carefully preserved to us, and accessible to
every one in the British Museum, and one or two of these deserve passing
notice. Nothing can be more suitable for its purpose than the "Workman's
Stool:" the seat is precisely like that of a modern kitchen chair
(all wood), slightly concaved to promote the sitter's comfort, and supported
by three legs curving outwards. This is simple, convenient, and admirably
adapted for long service. For a specimen of more ornamental work, the
folding stool in the same glass case should be examined; the supports
are crossed in a similar way to those of a modern camp-stool and the
lower parts of the legs carved as heads of geese, with inlayings of ivory
to assist the design and give richness to its execution.</p>

<p>Portions of legs and rails, turned as if by a modern lathe, mortice
holes and tenons, fill us with wonder as we look upon work which, at the
most modern computation, must be 3,000 years old, and may be of a date
still more remote.</p>

<p>In the same room, arranged in cases round the wall, is a collection
of several objects which, if scarcely to be classed under the head of
furniture, are articles of luxury and comfort, and demonstrate the
extraordinary state of civilisation enjoyed by the old Egyptians, and
help us to form a picture of their domestic habits.</p>

<p>(<em>From a Wall Painting at Thebes.</em>)</p></div>
</div>

<p>Amongst these are boxes, some inlaid with various woods, and also with
little squares of bright turquoise blue pottery let in as a relief; others
veneered with ivory; wooden spoons carved in most intricate designs, of
which one, representing a girl amongst lotus flowers, is a work of great
artistic skill; boats of wood, head rests, and models of parts of houses
and granaries, together with writing materials, different kinds of tools and
implements, and a quantity of personal ornaments and requisites.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>"For furniture, various woods were employed, ebony, acacia, or sont,
cedar, sycamore, and others of species not determined. Ivory, both of
the hippopotamus and elephant, were used for inlaying, as also were glass
pastes; and specimens of marquetry are not uncommon. In the paintings
in the tombs, gorgeous pictures and gilded furniture are depicted. For
cushions and mattresses, linen cloth and colored stuffs, filled with feathers
of the waterfowl, appear to have been used, while seats have plaited
bottoms of linen cord or tanned and dyed leather thrown over them, and
sometimes the skins of panthers served this purpose. For carpets they
used mats of palm fibre, on which they often sat. On the whole an
Egyptian house was lightly furnished, and not encumbered with so many
articles as are in use at the present day."</p>

<p>The above paragraph forms part of the notice with which the late
Dr. Birch, the eminent antiquarian, formerly at the head of this department
of the British Museum, has prefaced a catalogue of the antiquities
alluded to. The visitor to the Museum should be careful to procure one
of these useful and inexpensive guides to this portion of its contents.</p>

<p>Some illustrations taken from ancient statues and bas-reliefs in the
British Museum, from copies of wall paintings at Thebes and other
sources, give us a good idea of the furniture of this ancient people.
Amongst the group of illustrations on p. <a href="#Page_6">6</a> will be seen a representation
of a wooden head-rest, which prevented the disarrangement of the coiffure
of an Egyptian lady of rank. A very similar head-rest, with a cushion
attached for comfort to the neck, is still in common use by the Japanese
of the present day.</p>

<h5>GREEK FURNITURE.</h5>

<p>An early reference to Greek furniture is made by Homer, who describes
coverlids of dyed wool, tapestries, carpets, and other accessories, which
must therefore have formed part of the contents of a great man's
residence centuries before the period which we recognise as the
"meridian" of Greek Art.</p>

</div>

<p>In the second Vase-room of the British Museum the painting on one
of these vases represents two persons sitting on a couch, upon which is
a cushion of rich material, while for the comfort of the sitters there is a
footstool, probably of ivory. Facing page 8 there is an illustration
of a bas-relief in stone, "Bacchus received as a guest by Icarus," in
which the couch has turned legs and the feet are ornamented with carved
leaf work. Illustrations of tripods used for sacred or other purposes, and
as supports for braziers, lead us to the conclusion that tables were made
of wood, of marble, and of metal; also folding chairs, and couches for
sleeping and resting, but not for reclining at meals, as was the fashion at
a later period. In most of the designs for these various articles of
furniture there is a similarity of treatment of the head, legs, and feet of
lions, leopards, and sphinxes to that which we have noticed in the
Assyrian patterns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>The description of an interesting piece of furniture may be noticed
here, because its date is verified by its historical associations, and it was
seen and described by Pausanias about 800 years afterwards. This is the
famous chest of Cypselus of Corinth, the story of which runs that when
his mother's relations, having been warned by the Oracle of Delphi, that
her son would prove formidable to the ruling party, sought to murder
him, his life was saved by his concealment in this chest, and he became
ruler of Corinth for some 30 years (<span class="smcapa">B.C.</span> 655-625). It is said to
have been made of cedar, carved and decorated with figures and bas-reliefs,
some in ivory, some in gold or ivory part gilt, and inlaid on
all four sides and on the top.</p>

<p>The peculiar laws and customs of the Greeks at the time of their
greatest prosperity were not calculated to encourage display or luxury in
private life, or the collection of sumptuous furniture. Their manners were
simple and their discipline was very severe. Statuary, sculpture of the
best kind, painting of the highest merit&mdash;in a word, the best that Art
could produce&mdash;were all dedicated to the national service in the enrichment
of Temples and other public buildings, the State having indefinite
and almost unlimited power over the property of all wealthy citizens. The
public surroundings of an influential Athenian were therefore in direct
contrast to the simplicity of his home, which contained the most meagre
supply of chairs and tables, while the <em>chefs d'œuvre</em> of Phidias, Apelles
and Praxiteles adorned the Senate House, the Theatre, and the Temple.</p>

<p>There were some exceptions to this rule, and we have records that
during the later years of Greek prosperity such simplicity was not
observed. Alcibiades is said to have been the first to have his house
painted and decorated, and Plutarch tells us that he kept the painter
Agatharcus a prisoner until his task was done, and then dismissed him
with an appropriate reward. Another ancient writer relates that "The
guest of a private house was enjoined to praise the decorations of the
ceilings and the beauty of the curtains suspended from between the
columns." This occurs, according to Mr. Perkins, the American translator
of Dr. Falke's German book "Kunst im Hause," in the "Wasps of
Aristophanes," written <span class="smcapa">B.C.</span> 422.</p>

<p>The illustrations, taken from the best authorities in the British
Museum, the National Library of Paris, and other sources, shew the
severe style adopted by the Greeks in their furniture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>


<h5>ROMAN FURNITURE.</h5>

<p>As we are accustomed to look to Greece in the time of Pericles
for purity of style and perfection of taste in Art, so do we naturally
expect its gradual demoralisation in its transfer to the great Roman
Empire. From that little village on the Palatine Hill, founded some 750
years <span class="smcapa">B.C.</span>, Rome had spread and conquered in every direction, until in the
time of Augustus she was mistress of the whole civilized world, herself
the centre of wealth, civilisation, luxury, and power. Antioch in the
East, and Alexandria in the South, ranked next to her as great cities of
the world.</p>

<p>From the excavations of Herculaneum and Pompeii we have learned
enough to conceive some general idea of the social life of a wealthy
Roman in the time of Rome's highest prosperity. The houses had no
upper story, but enclosed two or more quadrangles, or courts, with
arcades into which the rooms opened, receiving air and ventilation from
the centre open court. The illustration opposite p. <a href="#Page_12">12</a> will give an idea
of this arrangement.</p>

<p>In Mr. Hungerford Pollen's useful handbook there is a description
of each room in a Roman house, with its proper Latin title and
purpose; and we know from other descriptions of Ancient Rome that
the residences in the Imperial City were divided into two distinct
classes&mdash;that of the <em>domus</em> and <em>insula</em>, the former being the dwellings of the
Roman nobles, and corresponding to the modern <em>Palazzi</em>, while the latter
were the habitations of the middle and lower classes. Each <em>insula</em>
consisted of several sets of apartments, generally let out to different
families, and was frequently surrounded by shops. The houses described
by Mr. Pollen appear to have had no upper story, but as ground
became more valuable in Rome, houses were built to such a height as
to be a source of danger, and in the time of Augustus there were not
only strict regulations as to building, but the height was limited to
70 feet. The Roman furniture of the time was of the most costly kind.
Tables were made of marble, gold, silver, and bronze, and were engraved,
damascened, plated, and enriched with precious stones. The chief
woods used were cedar, pine, elm, olive, ash, ilex, beech, and maple.
Ivory was much used, and not only were the arms and legs of couches
and chairs carved to represent the limbs of animals, as has been noted
in the Assyrian, Egyptian, and Greek designs, but other parts of furniture
were ornamented by carvings in bas-relief of subjects taken from Greek
mythology and legend. Veneers were cut and applied, not as some have
supposed for the purpose of economy, but because by this means the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
most beautifully marked or figured specimens of the woods could be
chosen, and a much richer and more decorative effect produced than
would be possible when only solid timber was used. As a prominent
instance of the extent to which the Romans carried the costliness of
some special pieces of furniture, we have it recorded on good authority
(Mr. Pollen) that the table made for Cicero cost a million sesterces, a
sum equal to about £9,000, and that one belonging to King Juba was
sold by auction for the equivalent of £10,000.</p>

<p>Cicero's table was made of a wood called Thyine&mdash;wood which
was brought from Africa and held in the highest esteem. It was valued
not only on account of its beauty but also from superstitious or religious
reasons. The possession of thyine wood was supposed to bring good luck,
and its sacredness arose from the fact that from it was produced the
incense used by the priests. Dr. Edward Clapton, of St. Thomas'
Hospital, who made a collection of woods named in the Scriptures,
managed to secure a specimen of thyine, which a friend of his obtained
on the Atlas Mountains. It resembles the woods which we know as
tuyere and amboyna.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Roman, like Greek houses, were divided into two portions&mdash;the
front for the reception of guests and the duties of society, with the back
for household purposes, and the occupation of the wife and family; for
although the position of the Roman wife was superior to that of her
Greek contemporary, which was little better than that of a slave, still it
was very different to its later development.</p>

<p>The illustration following p. <a href="#Page_16">16</a>, of a repast in the house of Sallust,
represents the host and his eight male guests reclining on the seats of
the period, each of which held three persons, and was called a triclinium,
making up the favourite number of a Roman dinner party, and possibly
giving us the proverbial saying&mdash;"Not less than the Graces nor more
than the Muses"&mdash;which is still held to be a popular regulation for a
dinner party.</p>

</div>

<p>From discoveries at Herculaneum and Pompeii a great deal of
information has been gained of the domestic life of the wealthier Roman
citizens, and there is a useful illustration on the preceding page of the
furniture of a library or study in which the designs are very similar to
the Greek ones we have noticed; it is not improbable they were made
and executed by Greek workmen.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the books such as were then used, instead of
being placed on shelves or in a bookcase, were kept in round boxes called
<em>Scrinia</em>, which were generally of beech wood, and could be locked or
sealed when required. The books in rolls or sewn together were thus
easily carried about by the owner on his journeys.</p>

<p>Mr. Hungerford Pollen mentions that wearing apparel was kept in
<em>vestiaria</em>, or wardrobe rooms, and he quotes Plutarch's anecdote of the
purple cloaks of Lucullus, which were so numerous that they must have
been stored in capacious hanging closets rather than in chests.</p>

<p>In the <em>atrium</em>, or public reception room, was probably the best
furniture in the house. According to Moule's "Essay on Roman Villas,"
"it was here that numbers assembled daily to pay their respects to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
patron, to consult the legislator, to attract the notice of the statesman, or
to derive importance in the eyes of the public from the apparent intimacy
with a man in power."</p>

<p>The growth of the Roman Empire eastward, the colonisation of
Oriental countries, and subsequently the establishment of an Eastern
Empire, produced gradually an alteration in Greek design, and though, if
we were discussing the merits of design and the canons of taste, this
might be considered a decline, still its influence on furniture was doubtless
to produce more ease and luxury, more warmth and comfort, than
would be possible if the outline of every article of useful furniture were
decided by a rigid adherence to classical principles. We have seen that
this was more consonant with the public life of an Athenian; but the
Romans, in the later period of the Empire, with their wealth, their
extravagance, their slaves, their immorality and gross sensuality, lived in
a splendour and with a prodigality that well accorded with the gorgeous
coloring of Eastern hangings and embroideries, of rich carpets and
comfortable cushions, of the lavish use of gold and silver, and meretricious
and redundant ornament.</p>

<p>This slight sketch, brief and inadequate as it is, of a history of
furniture from the earliest time of which we have any record, until from
the extraordinary growth of the vast Roman Empire, the arts and manufactures
of every country became as it were centralised and focussed in
the palaces of the wealthy Romans, brings us down to the commencement
of what has been deservedly called "the greatest event in history"&mdash;the
decline and fall of this enormous empire. For fifteen generations, for
some five hundred years, did this decay, this vast revolution, proceed to
its conclusion. Barbarian hosts settled down in provinces they had
overrun and conquered, the old Pagan world died as it were, and the
new Christian era dawned. From the latter end of the second century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
until the last of the Western Cæsars, in <span class="smcapa">A.D.</span> 476, it is, with the exception
of a short interval when the strong hand of the great Theodosius stayed
the avalanche of Rome's invaders, one long story of the defeat and
humiliation of the citizens of the greatest power the world has ever
known. It is a vast drama that the genius and patience of a Gibbon
has alone been able to deal with, defying almost by its gigantic
catastrophes and ever raging turbulence the pen of history to chronicle
and arrange. When the curtain rises on a new order of things, the age
of Paganism has passed away, and the period of the Middle Ages will
have commenced.</p>

<p><span class="figleft100"><img src="images/i_017a.jpg" width="160" height="250" alt="T" /></span>HE history of furniture is so thoroughly a
part of the history of the manners and
customs of different peoples, that one can
only understand and appreciate the several
changes in style, sometimes gradual and
sometimes rapid, by reference to certain
historical events and influences by which
such changes were effected.</p>

<p>Thus, we have during the space of
time known as the Middle Ages, a stretch
of some 1,000 years, dating from the fall
of Rome itself, in <span class="smcapa">A.D.</span> 476 to the capture
of Constantinople by the Turks under
Mahomet II. in 1453, an historical panorama
of striking incidents and great
social changes bearing upon our subject.
It was a turbulent and violent period,
which saw the completion of Rome's downfall, the rise of the
Carlovingian family, the subjection of Britain by the Saxons, the Danes,
and the Normans; the extraordinary career and fortunes of Mahomet;
the conquest of Spain and a great part of Africa by the Moors; and the
Crusades, which united in a common cause the swords and spears of
friend and foe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the age of monasteries and convents, of religious persecutions
and of heroic struggles of the Christian Church. It was the age of feudalism,
chivalry, and war, but towards its close a time of comparative civilisation
and progress, of darkness giving way to the light which followed;
the night of the Middle Ages preceding the dawn of the Renaissance.</p>

<p>With the growing importance of Constantinople, the capital of the
Eastern Empire, families of well-to-do citizens flocked thither from other
parts, bringing with them all their most valuable possessions: and the
houses of the great became rich in ornamental furniture, the style of which
was a mixture of Eastern and Roman,&mdash;that is, a corruption of the early
Classic Greek developing into the style known as Byzantine. The influence
of Christianity upon the position of women materially affected the customs
and habits of the people. Ladies were allowed to be seen in chariots
and open carriages, the designs of which, therefore, improved and became
more varied; the old custom of reclining at meals ceased, and guests sat
on benches; and though we have, with certain exceptions, such as the
chair of St. Peter at Rome, and that of Maximian in the Cathedral
at Ravenna, no specimens of furniture of this time, we have in the old
Byzantine ivory bas-reliefs such representations of circular throne chairs
and of ecclesiastical furniture, as suffice to show the class of woodwork
then in vogue.</p>

<p>The chair of St. Peter is one of the most interesting relics of the
Middle Ages. The woodcut will shew the design, which is, like other
work of the period, Byzantine, and the following description is taken from
Mr. Hungerford Pollen's introduction to the South Kensington catalogue:&mdash;"The
chair is constructed of wood, overlaid with carved ivory work and
gold. The back is bound together with iron. It is a square with solid
front and arms. The width in front is 39 inches; the height in front 30
inches, shewing that a scabellum or footstool must have belonged to it....
In the front are 18 groups or compositions from the Gospels,
carved in ivory with exquisite fineness, and worked with inlay of the purest
gold. On the outer sides are several little figures carved in ivory. It
formed, according to tradition, part of the furniture of the house of the
Senator Pudens, an early convert to the Christian faith. It is he who
gave to the Church his house in Rome, of which much that remains is
covered by the Church of St. Pudenziana. Pudens gave this chair to St.
Peter, and it became the throne of the See. It was kept in the old
Basilica of St. Peter's." Since then it has been transferred from place to
place, until now it remains in the present Church of St. Peter's, but is
completely hidden from view by the seat or covering made in 1667, by
Bernini, out of bronze taken from the Pantheon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Much has been written about this famous chair. Cardinal Wiseman
and the Cavaliere de Rossi have defended its reputation and its history,
and Mr. Nesbitt, some years ago, read a paper on the subject before the
Society of Antiquaries.</p>

<p>Formerly there was in Venice another "chair of St. Peter," of which
there is a sketch from a photograph in Mrs. Oliphant's "Makers of
Venice." It is said to have been a present from the Emperor Michael,
son of Theophilus (824-864), to the Venetian Republic in recognition of
services rendered, by either the Doge Gradonico, who died in 864, or his
predecessor, against the Mahommedan incursions. Fragments only now
remain, and these are preserved in the Church of St. Pietro, at Castello.</p>

<p>There is also a chair of historic fame preserved in Venice, and now
kept in the treasury of St. Mark's. Originally in Alexandria, it was sent
to Constantinople and formed part of the spoils taken by the Venetians
in 1204. Like both the other chairs, this was also ornamented with ivory
plaques, but these have been replaced by ornamental marble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>The earliest of the before-mentioned chairs, namely, the one at Ravenna,
was made for the Archbishop about 546 to 556, and is thus described in
Mr. Maskell's "Handbook on Ivories," in the Science and Art series:&mdash;"The
chair has a high back, round in shape, and is entirely covered
with plaques of ivory arranged in panels carved in high relief with scenes
from the Gospels and with figures of saints. The plaques have borders
with foliated ornaments, birds and animals; flowers and fruits filling
the intermediate spaces. Du Sommerard names amongst the most
remarkable subjects, the Annunciation, the Adoration of the Wise Men,
the Flight into Egypt, and the Baptism of Our Lord." The chair has
also been described by Passeri, the famous Italian antiquary, and a
paper upon it was read by Sir Digby Wyatt, before the Arundel Society,
in which he remarked that as it had been fortunately preserved as a
holy relic, it wore almost the same appearance as when used by the
prelate for whom it was made, save for the beautiful tint with which
time had invested it.</p>

<p>Long before the general break up of the vast Roman Empire,
influences had been at work to decentralise Art, and cause the migration
of trained and skilful artisans to countries where their work would build
up fresh industries, and give an impetus to progress, where hitherto there
had been stagnation. One of these influences was the decree issued in
<span class="smcapa">A.D.</span> 726 by Leo III., Emperor of the Eastern Empire, prohibiting all
image worship. The consequences to Art of such a decree were doubtless
similar to the fanatical proceedings of the English Puritans of the
seventeenth century; and artists, driven from their homes, were scattered
to the different European capitals, where they were gladly received and
found employment and patronage.</p>

<p>It should be borne in mind that at this time Venice was gradually
rising to that marvellous position of wealth and power which she afterwards
held.</p>

<div class="container">

</div>
</div>

<p>Her wealthy merchants were well acquainted with the arts and
manufactures of other countries, and Venice would be just one of those
cities to attract the artist refugee. It is indeed here that wood carving
as an Art may be said to have specially developed itself, and though,
from its destructible nature, there are very few specimens extant dating
from this early time, yet we shall see that two or three hundred years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
later, ornamental woodwork flourished in a state of perfection which must
have required a long probationary period.</p>

<p>Turning from Venice. During the latter end of the eighth century
the star of Charlemagne was in the ascendant, and though we have no
authentic specimen, and scarcely a picture of any wooden furniture of this
reign, we know that, in appropriating the property of the Gallo-Romans,
the Frank Emperor-King and his chiefs were in some degree educating
themselves to higher notions of luxury and civilisation. Paul Lacroix, in
"Manners, Customs, and Dress of the Middle Ages," tells us that the
<em>trichorum</em>, or dining room, was generally the largest hall in the palace:
two rows of columns divided it into three parts, one for the royal family,
one for the officers of the household, and the third for the guests, who
were generally numerous. No person of rank who visited the King
could leave without sitting at his table or at least draining a cup to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
health. The King's hospitality was magnificent, especially on great
religious festivals, such as Christmas and Easter.</p>

<p>In other portions of this work of reference we read of "boxes"
to hold articles of value, and of rich hangings, but beyond such allusions
little can be gleaned of any furniture besides. The celebrated chair
of Dagobert (illustrated on p. <a href="#Page_21">21</a>), now in the Louvre, and of which there
is a cast in the South Kensington Museum, dates from some 150
years before Charlemagne, and is probably the only specimen of
furniture belonging to this period which has been handed down to us.
It is made of gilt bronze, and is said to be the work of a monk.</p>

<p>For the designs of furniture of the tenth to the fourteenth centuries
we are in a great measure dependent upon old illuminated manuscripts
and missals of these remote times. There are some illustrations of the
seats of State used by sovereigns on the occasions of grand banquets, or
of some ecclesiastical function, to be found in the valuable collections of
old documents in the British Museum and the National Libraries of Paris
and Brussels. It is evident from these authorities that the designs of State
furniture in France and other countries dominated by the Carlovingian
monarchs were of Byzantine character, that pseudo-classic style which
was the prototype of furniture of about a thousand years later, when the
Cæsarism of Napoleon I., during the early years of the nineteenth century,
produced so many designs which we now recognise as "Empire."</p>

<p>No history of mediæval woodwork would be complete without noticing
the Scandinavian furniture and ornamental wood carving of the tenth to
the fifteenth centuries. There are in the South Kensington Museum
plaster casts of some three or four carved doorways of Norwegian
workmanship, of the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth centuries, in which
scrolls are entwined with contorted monsters, or, to quote Mr. Lovett's
description, "dragons of hideous aspect and serpents of more than usually
tortuous proclivities." The woodcut of a carved lintel conveys a fair
idea of this work, and also of the old juniper wood tankards of a much
later time.</p>

<p>There are also at Kensington other casts of curious Scandinavian
woodwork of more Byzantine treatment, the originals of which are in
the Museums of Stockholm and Copenhagen, where the collection of
antique woodwork of native production is very large and interesting,
and proves how wood carving, as an industrial Art, has flourished in
Scandinavia from the early Viking times. One can still see in the old
churches of Borgund and Hitterdal much of the carved woodwork of
the seventh and eighth centuries; and lintels and porches full of national
character are to be found in Thelemarken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>Under the heading of "Scandinavian" may be included the very early
Russian school of ornamental woodwork. Before the accession of the
Romanoff dynasty in the sixteenth century, the Ruric race of kings
came originally from Finland, then a province of Sweden; and so far
as one can see from old illuminated manuscripts, there was a similarity
of design to those of the early Norwegian and Swedish carved lintels
which have been noticed above.</p>

<p>The coffers and caskets of early mediæval times were no inconsiderable
items in the valuable furniture of a period when the list of articles
coming under that definition was so limited. These were made in oak
for general use, and some were of good workmanship; but of the very
earliest none remain. There were, however, others, smaller and of a
special character, made in ivory of the walrus and elephant, of horn and
whalebone, besides those of metal. In the British Museum is one of
these, of which the cover is illustrated on the following page, representing
a man defending his house against an attack by enemies armed with
spears and shields. Other parts of the casket are carved with subjects
and runic inscriptions which have enabled Mr. Stephens, an authority on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
this period of archæology, to assign its date to the eighth century, and
its manufacture to that of Northumbria. It most probably represents a
local incident, and part of the inscription refers to a word signifying
"treachery." It was purchased by the late Sir A. W. Franks, F.S.A.,
and is one of the many valuable specimens given to the British Museum
by its generous curator.</p>

<p>Of the furniture of our own country previous to the eleventh or
twelfth centuries we know but little. The habits of the Anglo-Saxons
were rude and simple, and they advanced but slowly in civilisation
until after the Norman invasion. To convey, however, to our minds
some idea of the interior of a Saxon thane's castle, we may avail
ourselves of Sir Walter Scott's antiquarian research, and borrow his
description of the chief apartment in Rotherwood, the hospitable hall
of Cedric the Saxon. Though the time treated of in "Ivanhoe" is
quite at the end of the twelfth century, yet we have in Cedric a type of
man who would have gloried in retaining the customs of his ancestors,
who detested and despised the new-fashioned manners of his conquerors,
and who came of a race that had probably done very little in the way of
"refurnishing" for some generations. If, therefore, we have the reader's
pardon for relying upon the <em>mise en scéne</em> of a novel for an authority,
we shall imagine the more easily what kind of furniture our Anglo-Saxon
forefathers indulged in.</p>

<p>"In a hall, the height of which was greatly disproportioned to its
extreme length and width, a long oaken table&mdash;formed of planks rough
hewn from the forest, and which had scarcely received any polish&mdash;stood
ready prepared for the evening meal.... On the sides
of the apartment hung implements of war and of the chase, and there
were at each corner folding doors which gave access to the other parts
of the extensive building.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>(<em>From the Harleian MSS. in the British Museum.</em>)</p></div>
</div>

<p>"The other appointments of the mansion partook of the rude simplicity
of the Saxon period, which Cedric piqued himself upon maintaining. The
floor was composed of earth mixed with lime, trodden into a hard
substance, such as is often employed in flooring our modern barns.
For about one quarter of the length of the apartment, the floor was
raised by a step, and this space, which was called the daïs, was occupied
only by the principal members of the family and visitors of distinction.
For this purpose a table richly covered with scarlet cloth was placed.
transversely across the platform, from the middle of which ran the
longer and lower board, at which the domestic and inferior persons
fed, down towards the bottom of the hall. The whole resembled the
form of the letter <b>T</b>, or some of those ancient dinner tables which,
arranged on the same principles, may still be seen in the ancient
colleges of Oxford and Cambridge. Massive chairs and settles of carved
oak were placed upon the daïs, and over these seats and the elevated
tables was fastened a canopy of cloth, which served in some degree
to protect the dignitaries who occupied that distinguished station
from the weather, and especially from the rain, which in some places
found its way through the ill-constructed roof. The walls of this upper
end of the hall, as far as the daïs extended, were covered with hangings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
or curtains, and upon the floor there was a carpet, both of which were
adorned with some attempts at tapestry or embroidery, executed with
brilliant or rather gaudy colouring. Over the lower range of table the
roof had no covering, the rough plastered walls were left bare, the rude
earthen floor was uncarpeted, the board was uncovered by a cloth, and
rude massive benches supplied the place of chairs. In the centre of the
upper table were placed two chairs more elevated than the rest, for
the master and mistress of the family. To each of these was added
a footstool curiously carved and inlaid with ivory, which mark of
distinction was peculiar to them."</p>

<p>A drawing in the Harleian MSS. in the British Museum is shewn on
page <a href="#Page_25">25</a>, illustrating a Saxon mansion in the ninth or tenth century.
There is the hall in the centre, with "chamber" and "bower" on either
side; there being only a ground floor, as in the earlier Roman houses.
According to Mr. Wright, F.S.A., who has written on the subject of
Anglo-Saxon manners and customs, there was only one instance recorded
of an upper floor at this period, and that was in an account of an
accident which happened to the house in which the Witan or Council of
St. Dunstan met, when, according to the ancient chronicle which he
quotes, the Council fell from an upper floor, and St. Dunstan saved
himself from a similar fate by supporting his weight on a beam.</p>

<p>The illustration here given shews the Anglo-Saxon chieftain standing
at the door of his hall, with his lady, distributing food to the needy
poor. Other woodcuts represent Anglo-Saxon bedsteads, which were
little better than raised wooden boxes, with sacks of straw placed therein,
and these were generally in recesses. There are old inventories and wills
in existence which shew that some value and importance was attached
to these primitive contrivances, which at this early period in our history
were the luxuries of only a few persons of high rank. A certain will
recites that the "bedclothes (bed-reafs) with a curtain (hyrfte) and
sheet (hepp-scrytan), and all that thereto belongs," should be given to his
son.</p>

<p>In the account of the murder of King Athelbert by the Queen of
King Offa, as told by Roger of Wendover, we read of the Queen ordering
a chamber to be made ready for the Royal guest, which was adorned for
the occasion with what was then considered sumptuous furniture. "Near
the King's bed she caused a seat to be prepared, magnificently decked
and surrounded with curtains, and underneath it the wicked woman
caused a deep pit to be dug." The author from whom the above
translation is quoted adds with grim humour, "It is clear that this
room was on the ground floor."</p>

<p>There are in the British Museum other old manuscripts whose
illustrations have been laid under contribution, representing more innocent
occupations of our Anglo-Saxon forefathers. "The seat on the daïs," "an
Anglo-Saxon drinking party," and other illustrations which are in existence,
prove generally that, when the meal had finished, the table was removed
and drinking vessels were handed round from guest to guest; the story-tellers,
the minstrels, and the gleemen (conjurers) or jesters, beguiling the
festive hour with their different performances.</p>

<p>Some of these Anglo-Saxon houses had formerly been the villas of
the Romans during their occupation, which were altered and modified
to suit the habits and tastes of their later possessors. Lord Lytton
has given us, in the first chapter of his novel "Harold," the description
of one of such Saxonized Roman houses, in his reference to Hilda's
abode.</p>

<p>The gradual influence of Norman civilisation, however, had its effect,
though the unsettled state of the country prevented any rapid development
of industrial arts. The feudal system, by which every powerful
baron became a petty sovereign, often at war with his neighbour,
rendered it necessary that household treasures should be few and easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
transported or hidden, and the earliest oak chests which are still preserved
date from about this time. Bedsteads were not usual, except for kings,
queens, and great ladies; tapestry covered the walls, and the floors were
generally sanded. As the country became more calm, and security for
property more assured, this comfortless state of living disappeared; the
dress of the ladies was richer, and the general habits of the upper classes
were more refined. Stairs were introduced into houses, the "parloir" or
"talking room" was added, and fire places of brick or stonework were
made in some of the rooms, where previously the smoke was allowed to
escape through an aperture in the roof. Bedsteads were carved and draped
with rich hangings. Armoires made of oak and enriched with carvings,
and "Presses" date from about the end of the eleventh century.</p>

<p>It was during the reign of Henry III., 1216-1272, that wood-panelling
was first used for rooms, and considerable progress generally
appears to have been made about this period. Eleanor of Provence,
whom the King married in 1236, encouraged more luxury in the homes
of the barons and courtiers. Mr. Hungerford Pollen has quoted a royal
precept which was promulgated in this year, and it plainly shews that our
ancestors were becoming more refined in their tastes. The terms of
this precept were as follows, viz., "The King's great chamber at Westminster
to be painted a green colour like a curtain, that in the great
gable or frontispiece of the said chamber, a French inscription should
be painted, and that the King's little wardrobe should be painted of a
green colour to imitate a curtain."</p>

<p>In another 100 or 150 years we find mediæval Art approaching its
best period, not only in England, but in the great Flemish cities, such
as Bruges and Ghent, which in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
played so important a part in the history of that time. The taste for
Gothic architecture had now well set in, and we find that in this, as
in every change of style, the fashion in woodwork naturally followed
that of ornament in stone; indeed, in many cases it is more than
probable that the same hands which planned the cathedral or monastery
also drew the designs for furniture, especially as the finest specimens
of wood carving were devoted to the service of the church.</p>

<p>The examples, therefore, of the woodwork of this period to which
we have access are found to be mostly of Gothic pattern, with quaint
distorted conceptions of animals and reptiles, adapted to ornament the
structural part of the furniture, or for the enrichment of the panels.</p>

<p>To the end of the thirteenth century belongs the Coronation Chair
made for King Edward I., 1296-1300, and now in Westminster Abbey.
This historic relic is of oak, and the woodcut on the opposite page gives
an idea of the design and decorative carving. It is said that the
pinnacles on each side of the gabled back were formerly surmounted
by two leopards, of which only small portions remain. The famous
Coronation Stone, which, according to ancient legend, is the identical
one on which the patriarch Jacob rested his head at Bethel, when "he
tarried there all night because the sun was set, and he took of the stones
of that place and put them up for his pillows" (Gen. xxviii.), can be
seen through the quatrefoil openings under the seat.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The carved lions which support the chair are not original, but
modern work; and were re-gilt in honour of the Jubilee of Her Majesty
in 1887, when the chair was last used. The rest of the chair now shews
the natural colour of the oak, except the arms, which have a slight
padding on them. The wood was, however, formerly covered with a
coating of plaster, gilded over, and it is probably due to this protection
that it is now in such excellent preservation.</p>

<p>Standing by its side in Henry III.'s Chapel in Westminster Abbey
is another chair, similar, but lacking the trefoil Gothic arches, which are
carved on the sides of the original chair; this was made for and used by
Mary, daughter of James II. and wife of William III., on the occasion
of their double coronation. Mr. Hungerford Pollen has given us a long
description of this chair, with quotations from the different historical
notices which have appeared concerning it. The following is an extract
which he has taken from an old writer:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It appears that the King intended, in the first instance, to make
the chair in bronze, and that Eldam, the King's workman, had actually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
begun it. Indeed, some parts were even finished, and tools bought for
the clearing up of the casting. However, the King changed his mind,
and we have accordingly 100s. paid for a chair in wood, made after the
same pattern as the one which was to be cast in copper; also 13s. 4d.
for carving, painting, and gilding two small leopards in wood, which
were delivered to Master Walter, the King's painter, to be placed upon
and on either side of the chair made by him. The wardrobe account
of 29th Ed. I. shows that Master Walter was paid £1 19s. 7d. 'for
making a step at the foot of the new chair in which the Scottish stone
is placed; and for the wages of the carpenters and of the painters, and
for colours and gold employed, and for the making a covering to cover
the said chair.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1328, June 1, there was a royal writ ordering the abbot to deliver
up the stone to the Sheriff of London, to be carried to the Queen-Mother;
however, it was not sent. The chair has been used upon the
occasion of every coronation since that time, except in the case of
Mary, who is said to have used a chair specially sent by the Pope for
the occasion.</p>

<p>The above drawing of a chair in York Minster, and the two more
throne-like seats on a full-page illustration, will serve to shew the best
kind of ornamental Ecclesiastical furniture of the fourteenth century. In
the choir of Canterbury Cathedral there is a chair which has played
its part in history, and, although earlier than the above, it may be
conveniently mentioned here. This is the Archbishop's throne, and it
is also called the chair of St. Augustine. According to legend, the
Saxon kings were crowned thereon, but it is probably not earlier than
the thirteenth century. It is an excellent piece of stonework, with a
shaped back and arms, relieved from being quite plain by the back and
sides being panelled with a carved moulding.</p>

<p>Penshurst Place, near Tonbridge, the residence of the late Lord de l'Isle
and Dudley, the historic home of the Sydneys, is almost an unique example
of what a wealthy English gentleman's country house was about the
time of which we are writing, say the middle of the fourteenth century, or
during the reign of Edward III. By the courtesy of the late Lord de l'Isle,
the writer was allowed to examine many objects of great interest
there, and from the careful preservation of many original fittings and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
articles of furniture, one may still gain some idea of the "hall" as it
appeared when that part of the house was the scene of the chief events
in the daily life of the family&mdash;the raised daïs for host and honoured
guests, the better table which was placed there (illustrated on the
preceding page), and the commoner ones for the body of the hall; and
though the ancient buffet which displayed the gold and silver cups is
gone, one can see where it would have stood. Penshurst is said to
possess the only hearth of that period now remaining in England, an
octagonal space edged with stone in the centre of the hall, over which
was once the simple opening for the outlet of smoke through the roof;
and the old andirons or firedogs are still there.</p>

<p>An idea of the furniture of an apartment in France during the
fourteenth century is conveyed by the illustration on this page, and it is
very useful, because, although we have on record many descriptions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the appearance of the furniture of state apartments, we have very
few authenticated accounts of the way in which such domestic
chambers as the one occupied by "a knight and his lady" were
arranged. The prie-dieu chair was generally at the bedside, and had
a seat which lifted up, the lower part forming a boxlike receptacle
for devotional books, then so regularly used by a lady of the time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Towards the end of the fourteenth century there was in high quarters
a taste for bright and rich coloring; we have the testimony of an
old writer who describes the interior of the Hotel de Bohême, which,
after having been the residence of several great personages, was given
by Charles VI. of France in 1388 to his brother the Duke of Orleans.
"In this palace was a room used by the duke, hung with cloth of
gold, bordered with vermilion velvet embroidered with roses; the
Duchess had a room hung with vermilion satin embroidered with
crossbows, which were on her coat of arms; that of the Duke of
Burgundy was hung with cloth of gold embroidered with windmills.
There were besides eight carpets of glossy texture with gold flowers,
one representing 'the seven virtues and seven vices,' another the
history of Charlemagne, another that of Saint Louis. There were also
cushions of cloth of gold, twenty-four pieces of vermilion leather of
Aragon, and four carpets of Aragon leather, 'to be placed on the
floor of rooms in summer.' The favourite arm-chair of the Princess
is thus described in an inventory&mdash;'a chamber chair with four supports,
painted in fine vermilion, the seat and arms of which are covered in
vermilion morocco, or cordovan, worked and stamped with designs
representing the sun, birds, and other devices bordered with fringes of
silk and studded with nails.'"</p>

<p>The thirteenth and fourteenth centuries had been remarkable for
a general development of commerce; merchants of Venice, Genoa,
Florence, Milan, Ghent, Bruges, Antwerp, and many other famous cities
had traded extensively with the East and had grown opulent, and their
homes naturally shewed signs of wealth and comfort that in former times
had been impossible to any but princes and rich nobles. Laws had been
made in compliance with the complaints of the aristocracy, to place some
curb on the growing ambition of the "bourgeoisie"; thus we find an old
edict in the reign of Philippe the Fair (1285-1314)&mdash;"No bourgeois shall
have a chariot, nor wear gold, precious stones, nor crowns of gold and
silver. Bourgeois not being prelates or dignitaries of state shall not
have tapers of wax. A bourgeois possessing 2,000 pounds (tournois)
or more, may order for himself a dress of 12 sous<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> 6 deniers, and
for his wife one worth 16 sous at the most," etc., etc., etc.</p>

<p>This and many other similar regulations were made in vain: the
trading classes became more and more powerful, and we quote the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
description of a furnished apartment from P. Lacroix's "Manners and
Customs of the Middle Ages."</p>

<p>"The walls were hung with precious tapestry of Cyprus, on which
the initials and motto of the lady were embroidered, the sheets were of
fine linen of Rheims, and had cost more than 300 pounds, the quilt was
a new invention of silk and silver tissue, the carpet was like gold. The
lady wore an elegant dress of crimson silk, and rested her head and arms
on pillows ornamented with buttons of oriental pearls. It should be
remarked that this lady was not the wife of a great merchant, such as
those of Venice and Genoa, but of a simple retail dealer who was not
above selling articles for 4 sous; such being the case, we cannot wonder
that Christine de Pisan should have considered the anecdote 'worthy of
being immortalized in a book.'"</p>

<p>As we approach the end of the fourteenth century, we find canopies
added to the "chaires" or "chayers á dorseret," which were carved in
oak or chestnut, and sometimes elaborately gilded and picked out in
color. The canopied seats were very bulky and throne-like constructions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
and were abandoned towards the end of the fifteenth century; and it is
worthy of notice that though we have retained our word "chair,"
adopted from the Norman French, the French people discarded their
synonym in favour of its diminutive "chaise" to describe the somewhat
smaller and less massive seat which came into use in the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p>The skilled artisans of Paris had arrived at a very high degree of
excellence in the fourteenth century, and in old documents describing
valuable articles of furniture, care is taken to note that they are of
Parisian workmanship. According to Lacroix, there is an account of the
court silversmith, Etienne La Fontaine, which gives us an idea of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
amount of extravagance sometimes committed in the manufacture and
decorations of a chair, into which it was then the fashion to introduce
the incrustations of precious stones; thus for making a silver arm chair
and ornamenting it with pearls, crystals, and other stones, he charged the
King of France, in 1352, no less a sum than 774 louis.</p>

<p>The use of rich embroideries at state banquets and on grand occasions
appears to have commenced during the reign of Louis IX.&mdash;Saint Louis,
as he is called&mdash;and these were richly emblazoned with arms and devices.
Indeed, it was probably due to the fashion for rich stuffs and coverings
of tables, and of velvet embroidered cushions for the chairs, that the
practice of making furniture of the precious metals died out, and carved
wood came into favour.</p>

<p>Chairs of this period appear only to have been used on very special
occasions; indeed, they were too cumbersome to be easily moved from
place to place, and in a miniature from some MSS. of the early part
of the fifteenth century, which represents a state banquet, the guests are
seated on a long bench with the back carved in Gothic ornament of
the time. In Skeat's Dictionary, our modern word "banquet" is said
to be derived from the "bancs" or benches used on these occasions.</p>

have taken place, was also furnished with three "dressoirs" for the display

<p>The furniture of ordinary houses of this period was very simple.
Chests, more or less carved, and ornamented with iron work, settles of
oak or of chestnut, stools or benches with carved supports, a bedstead
and a prie-dieu chair, a table with plain slab supported on shaped
standards, would nearly complete the inventory of the furniture of the chief
room in a house of a well-to-do merchant in France until the fourteenth
century had turned. The table was narrow, apparently not more than
some 30 inches wide, and guests sat on one side only, the service taking
place from the unoccupied side of the table. In palaces and baronial
halls, the servants with dishes were followed by musicians, as shewn in
an old miniature of the time, reproduced on page <a href="#Page_39">39</a>.</p>

<p>Turning to German work of the fifteenth century, there is, in the
South Kensington Museum, a cast of the famous choir stalls in the
Cathedral of Ulm, which are considered to be the finest work of the
Swabian school of German wood carving. The magnificent panel of
foliage on the front, the Gothic triple canopy with the busts of Isaiah.
David, and Daniel, are thoroughly characteristic specimens of design; the
signature of the artist, Jörg Syrlin, with date 1468, are carved on the
work. There were originally 89 choir stalls, and the work occupied the
master from the date mentioned, 1468, until 1474.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>The illustrations of the two chairs of German Gothic furniture,
formerly in some of the old castles, are good examples of their time,
and are from drawings made on the spot by Prof. Heideloff.</p>

<p>There are in our South Kensington Museum some full sized plaster
casts of important specimens of woodwork of the fifteenth and two
previous centuries, and being of authenticated dates, we can compare
them with the work of the same countries after the Renaissance had
been adopted and had completely altered the design. Thus in Italy there
was, until the latter part of the fifteenth century, a mixture of Byzantine
and Gothic, of which we can see a capital example in the casts of the
celebrated Pulpit in the Baptistry of Pisa, the date of which is 1260.
The pillars are supported by lions, which, instead of being introduced
heraldically into the design, as would be the case some two hundred
years later, are bearing the whole weight of the pillars and an enormous
superstructure on the hollow of their backs in a most impossible manner.
The spandril of each arch is filled with a saint in a grotesque position
amongst Gothic foliage, and there is in many respects a marked contrast to
the casts of examples of the Renaissance period which are in the Museum.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>This transition from Mediæval and Gothic, to Renaissance, is clearly
noticeable in the woodwork of many cathedrals and churches in England
and in continental cities. It is evident that the chairs, stalls, and
pulpits in many of these buildings have been executed at different times,
and the change from one style to another is more or less marked. The
Flemish buffet illustrated (opposite page <a href="#Page_44">44</a>) is an example of this transition,
and may be contrasted with the French Gothic buffet illustrated on page <a href="#Page_43">43</a>,
and referred to on page <a href="#Page_44">44</a>. There is also in the central hall of the South<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Kensington Museum a plaster cast of a carved wood altar stall in the
Abbey of Saint Denis, France: the pilasters at the sides have the familiar
Gothic pinnacles, while the panels are ornamented with arabesques, scrolls,
and an interior in the Renaissance style; the date of this is late in the
fifteenth century.</p>

<p>English examples of this period are very scarce, and the buffet
illustrated here is a favourable specimen of our national work late in the
fifteenth century. While the crocketted enrichment in the brackets shews
the Gothic taste, there are mouldings and some flutings in the upper
part which mark the tendency to adopt classic ornament, which came
in at the end of the fifteenth century. It was probably made for one of
our old abbeys, but Mr. Seymour Lucas, R.A., to whom it belongs,
and from whose drawing the illustration is made, says it was for a long
time at Freenes Court, Sutton, the ancient seat of Sir Henry Linger.</p>

<p>The buffet on page <a href="#Page_43">43</a> is an excellent example of the best fifteenth
century French Gothic oak work, and the woodcut shews the arrangement
of gold and silver plate on the white linen cloth with embroidered
ends, in use at this time.</p>

<p>We have now arrived at a period in the history of furniture which
is confused, and difficult to arrange and classify. From the end of the
fourteenth century to the Renaissance is a time of transition, and specimens
may be easily mistaken as being of an earlier or later date than they
really are. M. Jacquemart notices this "gap," though he fixes its duration
from the thirteenth to the fifteenth century, and he quotes as an instance
of the indecision which characterised this interval, that workers in
furniture were described in different terms; the words coffer maker,
carpenter, and huchier (trunk-maker) frequently occurring to describe
the same class of artisan.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is only later that the word "menuisier," or joiner, appears, and we must enter upon
the period of the Renaissance before we find the term "cabinet maker," and later still, after
the end of the seventeenth century, we have such masters of their craft as Riesener described
as "ébenistes," the word being derived from ebony, which, with other eastern woods, came
into use after the Dutch settlement in Ceylon. Jacquemart also notices the fact that as
early as 1360 we have record of a specialist, "Jehan Petrot," as a
"chessboard maker."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="figleft100"><img src="images/i_047b.jpg" width="142" height="300" alt="I" /></span>T IS impossible to write about the period of the
Renaissance without grave misgivings as to the
ability to render justice to a period which has
employed the pens of many cultivated writers, and
to which whole volumes, innumerable, have been
devoted. Within the limited space of a single
chapter all that can be attempted is a brief glance
at the influence on design by which furniture and
woodwork were affected. Perhaps the simplest way
of understanding the changes which occurred, first
in Italy, and subsequently in other countries, is to
divide the chapter on this period into a series of
short notes arranged in the order in which Italian
influence would seem to have affected the designers
and craftsmen of several European nations.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the fifteenth century there
appears to have been an almost universal rage for
classical literature, and we believe some attempt was made to introduce
Latin as a universal language; it is certain that Italian Art was adopted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
by nation after nation, and a well-known writer on architecture (Mr.
Parker) has observed: "It was not until the middle of the nineteenth
century that the national styles of the different countries of Modern
Europe were revived."</p>

<p>As we look back upon the history of Art, assisted by the numerous
examples in our Museums, one is struck by the want of novelty in the
imagination of mankind. The glorious antique has always been our classic
standard, and it seems only to have been a question of time as to when
and how a return was made to the old designs of the Greek artists, then
to wander from them awhile, and again to return when the world, weary
of over-abundance of ornament, longed for the repose of simpler lines on
the principles which governed the Athenian artists of old.</p>


<h5>THE RENAISSANCE IN ITALY.</h5>

<p>Italy was the birthplace of the Renaissance. Leonardo da Vinci and
Raffaelle may be said to have guided, or led, the natural artistic instincts
of their countrymen to discard the Byzantine-Gothic which, as M.
Bonnaffé has said, was adopted by the Italians not as a permanent
institution, but "faute de mieux" as a passing fashion.</p>

<p>It is difficult to say with any certainty when the first commencement
of a new era actually takes place, but there is an incident related in
Michael Bryan's biographical notice of Leonardo da Vinci which gives
us an approximate date. Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan, had appointed
this great master Director of Painting and Architecture in his academy
in 1494, and, says Bryan, who obtained his information from contemporary
writers, "Leonardo no sooner entered on his office, than he banished
all the Gothic principles established by his predecessor, Michaelino, and
introduced the beautiful simplicity and purity of the Grecian and Roman
styles."</p>

<p>A few years after this date, Pope Julius II. commenced to build the
present magnificent Church of St. Peter's, designed by Bramante d'Urbino,
kinsman and friend of Raffaelle, to whose superintendence Pope Leo X.
confided the work on the death of the architect in 1514. Michael
Angelo had the charge committed to him some years after Raffaelle's
death.</p>

<p>These dates give us a very fair idea of the time at which this
important revolution in taste was taking place in Italy, at the end of the
fifteenth and the commencement of the following century, and carved
woodwork followed the new direction.</p>

<p>Leo X. was Pope in 1513. The period of peace which then ensued
after war, which for so many decades had disturbed Italy, as France or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Germany had in turn striven to acquire her fertile soil, gave the princes
and nobles leisure to rebuild and adorn their palaces; and the excavations
which were then made, brought to light many of the Works of Art
which had remained buried since the time when Rome was mistress of
the world. Leo X. was a member of that remarkable and powerful family
the Medicis, the very mention of which is to suggest the Renaissance,
and under his patronage, and with the co-operation of the reigning dukes
and princes of the different Italian states, artists were given encouragement
and scope for the employment of their talents. Michael Angelo,
Titian, Raffaelle Sanzio, Andrea del Sarto, Correggio, and many other
great artists were raising up monuments of everlasting fame; Palladio
was re-building the palaces of Italy, which were then the wonder of the
world; Benvenuto Cellini and Lorenzo Ghiberti were designing those
marvellous <em>chefs d'œuvre</em> in gold, silver, and bronze which are now so
rare; and a host of illustrious artists were producing work which has
made the sixteenth century famous for all time.</p>

</div>

<p>The circumstances of the Italian noble caused him to be very
amenable to Art influence. Living chiefly out of doors, his climate
rendered him less dependent on the comforts of small rooms, to which
more northern people were attached, and his ideas would naturally incline
towards pomp and elegance, rather than to home life and utility. Instead
of the warm chimney corner and the comfortable seat, he preferred furniture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of a more palatial character for the adornment of the lofty and spacious
saloons of his palace, and therefore we find the buffet elaborately carved
with a free treatment of the classic antique which marks the time; it was
frequently "garnished" with the beautiful majolica of Urbino, of Pesaro,
and of Gubbio. The sarcophagus, or <em>cassone</em>, of oak, or more commonly
of chestnut or walnut, sometimes painted and gilded, sometimes carved
with scrolls and figures; the cabinet designed with architectural outline,
and fitted up inside with steps and pillars like a temple; chairs which
are wonderful to look upon as guardians of a stately doorway, but
uninviting as seats; tables inlaid, gilded, and carved, with slabs of
marble or of Florentine mosaic work, but which from their height are
as a rule impossible to use for any domestic purpose; mirrors with
richly carved and gilded frames: these are all so many evidences of a
style which is palatial rather than domestic, in design as in proportion.</p>

<p>The walls of these handsome saloons or galleries were hung with
rich velvet of Genoese manufacture, with stamped and gilt leather, and
a composition ornament was also applied to woodwork, and then gilded
and painted, a kind of decoration termed "gesso work."</p>

<p>A rich effect was produced on the carved console tables, chairs,
stools and frames intended for gilding, by the method employed by the
Venetian and Florentine craftsmen, the gold leaf being laid on a red
preparation, and then the chief portions highly burnished. There are
in the South Kensington Museum several specimens of such work, and
now that time and wear have caused this red groundwork to shew
through the faded gold, the harmony of color is very satisfactory.
Other examples of fifteenth century Italian carving, such as the old
Cassone fronts, are picked out with gold, the remainder of the work
displaying the rich warm color of the walnut or chestnut wood, either
of which was most invariably used.</p>

<p>Of the smaller articles of furniture, the "bellows" and wall brackets
of this period deserve mention; the carving of these is very carefully
finished, and is frequently very elaborate. The illustration on page <a href="#Page_51">51</a>
is that of a pair bellows in the South Kensington Collection. In the
famous Magniac Collection, which was sold in July, 1892, a pair of very
finely carved Venetian bellows of this description realised the high price
of 455 guineas.</p>

<p>The enrichment of woodwork, by means of inlaying, deserves
mention. In the chapter on Ancient Furniture we have seen that ivory
was used as an inlaid ornament as early as six centuries before Christ,
but its revival and development in Europe probably commenced in
Venice about the end of the thirteenth century, in copies of geometrical
designs, let into ebony and brown walnut, and into a wood something
like rosewood; parts of boxes and chests of these materials are still in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
existence. Mr. Maskell tells us in his Handbook on "Ivories," that
probably owing to the difficulty of procuring ivory in Italy, bone of fine
quality was frequently used in its place. All this class of work was known

<p>Towards the end of the fourteenth century, makers of ornamental
furniture began to copy marble mosaic work, by making similar patterns
of different woods, and subsequently this branch of industrial Art
developed from such modest beginnings as the simple pattern of a star,
or bandings of different kinds of wood in the panel of a door, to
elaborate picture making, in which landscapes, views of churches, houses,
and picturesque ruins were copied, figures and animals being also introduced.
This work was naturally facilitated and encouraged by increasing
commerce between different nations, which rendered available a greater
variety of woods. In some of the early Italian "intarsia" the decoration
was cut into the surface of the panel, piece by piece. As artists became
more skilful, veneers were applied, and the effect was heightened by
burning with hot sand the parts requiring shading; and the lines caused
by the thickness of the sawcuts were filled in with black wood or stained
glue, to define the design more clearly.</p>

<p>The "mounting" of articles of furniture with metal enrichments
doubtless originated in the iron corner pieces and hinge plates which
were used to strengthen the old chests, of which mention has been
already made, and as the artificers began to render their productions
decorative as well as useful, what more natural progress than that the
iron corners, bandings, or fastenings, should be of ornamental forged or
engraved iron. In the sixteenth century, metal workers reached a
point of excellence which has never been surpassed, and those marvels
of mountings in steel, iron and brass were produced in Italy and
Germany, which are far more important as works of Art than the plain
and unpretending productions of the coffer maker, which are their <em>raison
d'etre</em>. The woodcut on p. <a href="#Page_53">53</a> represents a very good example of a "Coffre-fort"
in the South Kensington Collection. The decoration is bitten in
with acids so as to present the appearance of its being damascened, and
the complicated lock, shewn on the inside of the lid, is characteristic of
those safeguards for valuable documents at a time when the modern
burglar-proof safe had not been invented.</p>

<p>The illustration on the following page is from an example in the
same Museum, shewing a different decoration, the oval plaques of figures
and coats of arms being of carved ivory let into the surface of the coffer.
This is an early specimen, and belongs as much to the period treated in
the previous chapter as to that now under consideration.</p>

<p>"Pietra-durá," as an ornament, was first introduced into Italy during
the sixteenth century and became a fashion. This was an inlay of
highly-polished rare marbles, agates, hard pebbles, lapis lazuli, and
other stones; ivory was also carved and applied as a bas-relief, as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
as inlaid in arabesques of the most elaborate designs; tortoise-shell,
brass, mother-of-pearl, and other costly materials, were introduced, as
enrichments in the decoration of cabinets and of caskets. Silver plaques
embossed and engraved were pressed into the service as the native
princes of Florence, Urbino, Ferrara, and other independent cities vied
with Rome, Venice, and Naples in sumptuousness of ornament, and
lavishness of expense, until the inevitable period of decline supervened
in which exaggeration of ornament and prodigality of decoration gave
the eye no repose.</p>

<p>Edmond Bonnaffé, contrasting the latter period of Italian Renaissance
with that of sixteenth century French woodwork, has pithily remarked:
"<em>Chez eux, l'art du bois consiste à le dissimuler chez nous à le fair valoir.</em>"</p>

<p>Mr. Ruskin, in his "Stones of Venice," alludes to this over-ornamentation
of the later Renaissance in severe terms. After describing
the progress of Art in Venice from Byzantine to Gothic, and from
Gothic to Renaissance, he sub-divides the latter period into three
classes:&mdash;1. Renaissance grafted on Byzantine. 2. Renaissance grafted
on Gothic. 3. Renaissance grafted on Renaissance; and this last the
veteran Art critic calls "double darkness," one of his characteristic terms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
of condemnation which many of us cannot follow, but the spirit of
which we can appreciate.</p>

<p>Speaking generally of the character of ornament, we find that
whereas in the furniture of the Middle Ages, the subjects for carving
were taken from the lives of the saints or from metrical romance,
the Renaissance carvers illustrated scenes from classical mythology and
allegories, such as representations of the elements, seasons, months,
the cardinal virtues, or the battle scenes and triumphal processions of
earlier times.</p>

<p>The outlines and general designs of the earlier Renaissance cabinets
were apparently suggested by the old Roman triumphal arches and
sarcophagi; afterwards these were modified and became varied, elegant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
and graceful, but latterly as the period of decline was marked, the
outlines, as shewn in the two chairs on the preceding page, became

<p>The illustrations given of specimens of furniture of Italian Renaissance
render lengthy descriptions unnecessary. So far as it has been possible
to do so, a selection has been made to represent the different classes of
work, and as there are in the South Kensington Museum numerous
examples of cassone fronts, panels, chairs, and cabinets which can be
examined, it is easy to form an idea of the decorative woodwork made in
Italy during the period we have been considering.</p>


<h5>THE RENAISSANCE IN FRANCE.</h5>

<p>From Italy the great revival of industrial Art travelled to France.
Charles VIII., who for two years had held Naples (1494-96), brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
among other artists from Italy, Bernadino de Brescia and Domenico de
Cortona; and Art, which at this time was in a feeble, languishing state
in France, began to revive. Francis I. employed an Italian architect to
build the chateau of Fontainebleau, which had hitherto been but an
old-fashioned hunting-box in the middle of the forest, and Leonardo
da Vinci and Andrea del Sarto came from Florence to decorate the
interior. Guilio Romano, who had assisted Raffaelle to paint the loggie
of the Vatican, exercised an influence in France, which was transmitted
by his pupils for generations. The marriage of Henry II. with Catherine
de Medici increased the influence of Italian Art, and the subsequent
union of Marie de Medici with Henri Quatre continued that influence.
Diane de Poictiers, mistress of Henry II., was the patroness of artists;
and Fontainebleau has been well said to "reflect the glories of gay
and splendour loving kings, from François Premier to Henri Quatre."</p>

<p>Besides Fontainebleau, Francis I. built the Chateau of Chambord,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
that of Chenonceaux on the Loire, the Chateau de Madrid, and others,
and commenced the Louvre.</p>

<p>Following their King's example, the more wealthy of his subjects
rebuilt or altered their chateaux and hotels, decorated them in the
Italian style, and furnished them with cabinets, chairs, coffers, armoires,
tables, and various other articles, designed after the Italian models.</p>

<p>The character of the woodwork naturally accompanied the design of
the building. Fireplaces, which until the end of the fifteenth century had
been of stone, were now made of oak, richly carved and ornamented with
the armorial bearings of the "<em>seigneur</em>." The <em>Prie dieu</em> chair, which Viollet
le Duc tells us came into use in the fifteenth century, was now made
larger and more ornate, in some cases becoming what might almost be
termed a small oratory, the back being carved in the form of an altar,
and the utmost care lavished on the work. It must be remembered that
in France, until the end of the fifteenth century, there were no benches
or seats in the churches, and therefore, prayers were said by the
aristocracy in the private chapel of the chateau, and by the middle
classes in the chief room of the house.</p>

<p>The large high-backed chair of the sixteenth century "<em>chaire à haut
dossier</em>," the arm chair "<em>chaire à bras</em>," "<em>chaire tournante</em>," for domestic
use, are all of this time, and some illustrations will shew the highly
finished carved work of Renaissance style which prevailed.</p>

<p>Besides the "<em>chaire</em>," which was reserved for the "<em>seigneur</em>," there

<p>Cabinets were made with an upper and lower part; sometimes the
latter was in the form of a stand with caryatides figures like the
famous cabinet in the Chateau Fontainebleau, a vignette of which forms
the initial letter of this chapter; or were enclosed by doors generally
decorated with carving, the upper part having richly carved panels, which
when opened disclosed drawers with fronts minutely carved.</p>

<p>M. Edmond Bonnaffé, in his work on the sixteenth century furniture
of France, gives no less than 120 illustrations of "<em>tables</em>, <em>coffres</em>, <em>armoires</em>,
<em>dressoirs</em>, <em>sieges</em>, <em>et bancs</em>", manufactured at Orleans, Anjou, Maine, Touraine,
Le Berri, Lorraine, Burgundy, Lyons, Provence, Auvergne, Languedoc,
and other towns and districts, besides the Capital, which excelled in the
reputation of her "menuisiers," certain articles of furniture being
particularised in old documents as "<em>fait a Paris</em>."</p>

<p>He also mentions that Francis I. preferred to employ native
workmen, and that the Italians were retained only to furnish the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
designs and lead the new style; and in giving the names of the most
noted French cabinet makers and carvers of this time, he adds that
Jacques Lardant and Michel Bourdin received no less than 15,700
livres for a number of "<em>buffets de salles</em>," "<em>tables garnies de leur tréteaux</em>,"
"<em>chandeliers de bois</em>," and other articles.</p>

<p>The bedstead, of which there is an illustration on the opposite page,
is a good representation of French Renaissance. It formed part of the
contents of the Chateau of Pau, and belonged to Jeanne d'Albret, mother
of Henri Quatre, who was born at Pau in 1553. The bedstead is of
oak, and by time has acquired a rich warm tint, the details of the
carving remaining sharp and clear. On the lower cornice moulding,
the date 1562 is carved.</p>

<p>This, like other furniture and contents of Palaces in France,
forms part of the State or National Collection, of which there are
excellent illustrations and descriptions in M. Williamson's "Mobilier
National" a valuable contribution to the literature of this subject which
should be consulted.</p>

<p>Another example of four-post bedsteads of French sixteenth century
work is that of the one in the Cluny Museum, which is probably some
years later than the one at Pau, and in the carved members of the two
lower posts more resembles our English Elizabethan work.</p>

<p>An important collection of carved furniture of French Renaissance
was exhibited in <em>l'exposition rétrospective de Lyon</em>, held in that city in 1877,
and M. J. B. Giraud, <em>conservateur</em> of the Archæological Museums of Lyons,
has reproduced some fifty of the more important specimens in his
valuable work,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> published in 1880, giving the name of the lender of each
example and other details. The "Lyons" cabinet, of which there is an
illustration, following p. <a href="#Page_60">60</a>, is one of these, and is in the Collection of
Mr. E. Aynard. The "Spitzer" Collection, sold in Paris in 1893,
contained several fine examples of French Renaissance oak furniture, which
realised large prices.</p>

<p>Towards the latter part of the reign of Henri IV. the style of
decorative Art in France became debased and inconsistent. Construction
and ornamentation were guided by no principle, but followed the caprice
of the individual. Meaningless pilasters, entablatures, and contorted
cornices replaced the simpler outline and subordinate enrichment of the
time of Henri II., and until the great revival of taste under the "<em>grand
monarque</em>," there was in France a period of richly ornamented but ill-designed
decorative furniture. An example of this can be seen at South
Kensington in a plaster cast of a large chimney piece from the Chateau
of the Seigneur de Villeroy, near Menecy, by German Pillon, who died
in 1590. In this the failings mentioned above will be readily recognized,
and also in another example, namely, that of a carved oak door from
the Church of St. Maclou, Rouen, by Jean Goujon, in which the work
is very fine, but somewhat overdone with enrichment.</p>

<p>During the "Louis Trieze" period, chairs became more comfortable
than those of an earlier time. The word "chaise" as a diminutive of
"chaire" found its way into the French vocabulary to denote the less
throne-like seat which was in more ordinary use, and, instead of
being at this period entirely carved, it was upholstered in velvet, tapestry,
or needlework; the frame was covered, and only the legs and arms were
visible and slightly carved. In the illustration on p. <a href="#Page_62">62</a>, the King and
his courtiers are seated on chairs such as have been described. Marqueterie
was more common; large armoires, chests of drawers and knee-hole
writing tables were covered with an inlay of vases of flowers and birds,
of a brownish wood, with enrichments of bone and ivory, inserted in a
black ground of stained wood, very much like the Dutch inlaid furniture
of some years later, but with less color in the various veneers than is
found in the Dutch work. Mirrors became larger, the decoration of rooms
had ornamental friezes with lower portions of the walls panelled, and the
bedrooms of ladies of position began to be more luxuriously furnished.</p>

<p>It is somewhat singular that while Normandy very quickly adopted
the new designs in her buildings and her furniture, and Rouen carvers
and joiners became famous for their work, the neighbouring province,
Brittany, was conservative of her earlier designs. The sturdy Breton
has through all changes of style preserved much of the rustic quaintness
of his furniture, and when some years ago the writer was stranded in a
sailing trip up the Rance, owing to the shallow state of the river, and
had an opportunity of visiting some of the farm houses in the country
district a few miles from Dinan, there were still to be seen many
examples of this quaint rustic furniture. Curious beds, consisting of
shelves for parents and children, form a cupboard in the wall and are
shut in, during the day, by a pair of lattice doors of Moorish design,
with the wheel pattern and spindle perforations. These, with the armoire
of similar design, and the "huche" or chest with relief carving, of a
design part Moorish, part Byzantine, used as a step to mount to the bed
and also as a table, are still the <em>garniture</em> of a good farm house in Brittany.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>The earliest date of this quaint furniture is about the middle of the
fifteenth century, and has been handed down from father to son by
the more well-to-do farmers. The manufacture of armoires, cupboards,
tables, and doors, is still carried on near St. Malo, where also some of
the old specimens may be found.</p>


<h5>THE RENAISSANCE IN THE NETHERLANDS.</h5>

<p>In the Netherlands, the reigning princes of the great House of
Burgundy had prepared the soil for the Renaissance, and, by the marriage
of Mary of Burgundy with the Archduke Maximilian, the countries which
then were called Flanders and Holland passed under the Austrian rule.
This influence was continued by the taste and liberality of Margaret of
Austria, who, being appointed "Governor" of the Low Countries in
1507, seems to have introduced Italian artists and to have encouraged
native craftsmen. We are told that Corneille Floris introduced Italian
ornamentation and grotesque borders; that Pierre Coech, architect and
painter, adopted and popularised the designs of Vitruvius and Serlio.
Wood carvers multiplied and embellished churches and palaces, houses of
Burgomasters, Town Halls, and residences of wealthy citizens.</p>

<p>Oak, at first almost the only wood used, became monotonous, and as
a relief, ebony and other rare woods, introduced by the then commencing
commerce with the Indies, were made available for the embellishments
of furniture and woodwork of this time.</p>

<p>One of the most famous examples of rich wood carving is the
well known hall and chimney piece at Bruges with its group of cupidons
and armorial bearings, amongst an abundance of floral detail. This
over ornate <em>chef d'œuvre</em> was designed by Lancelot Blondel and Guyot
de Beauregrant, and its carving was the combined work of three craftsmen
celebrated in their day, Herman Glosencamp, André Rash and Roger de
Smet. There is in the South Kensington Museum a full-sized plaster
cast of this gigantic chimney piece, the lower part being colored black
to indicate the marble of which it was composed, with panels of alabaster
carved in relief, while the whole of the upper portion of the richly carved
ceiling of the room is of oak. This chimney piece is noteworthy, not only
artistically but historically, as being a monument in its way, in celebration
of the victory gained by Charles V. over Francis I. of France, in 1529,
at Pavia, the victorious sovereign being at this time not only Emperor
of Germany, but also enjoying amongst other titles those of Duke of
Burgundy, Count of Flanders, King of Spain and the Indies, etc., etc.
The large statues of the Emperor, of Ferdinand and Isabella, with some
thirty-seven heraldic shields of the different royal families with which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the conqueror claimed connection, are prominent features in the intricate
and elaborate design.</p>

<p>There is in the same part of the Museum a cast of the oak door of
the Council Chamber of the Hotel de Ville at Oudenarde, of a much less
elaborate character. Plain mullions divide sixteen panels carved in the
orthodox Renaissance style, with cupids bearing tablets, from which are
depending floral scrolls, and at the sides the supports are columns, with
the lower parts carved and standing on square pedestals. The date of
this work is 1534, somewhat later than the Bruges carving, and is a
representative specimen of the Flemish work of this period.</p>

<p>The clever Flemish artist so thoroughly copied the models of his
different masters, that it has become exceedingly difficult to speak
positively as to the identity of much of the woodwork, and to distinguish
it from German, English, or Italian, although as regards the latter we
have seen that walnut wood was employed very generally, whereas in
Flanders, oak was nearly always used for figure work.</p>

<p>After the period of the purer forms of the first Renaissance, the best
time for carved woodwork and decorative furniture in the Netherlands
was probably the seventeenth century, when the Flemish designers and
craftsmen had ceased to copy the Italian patterns, and had established
the style which we recognise as "Flemish Renaissance."</p>

Rembrandt, Metsu, Van Mieris&mdash;all belong to this time, and in some of
the fine interiors represented by these Old Masters, in which embroidered
curtains and rich coverings relieve the sombre colors of the dark carved
oak furniture, there is a richness of effect which the artist could scarcely
have imagined, but which he must have observed in the houses of the
rich burghers of prosperous Flanders.</p>

<p>In the chapter on Jacobean furniture, we shall see the influence and
assistance which England gained from Flemish woodworkers; and the
similarity of the treatment in both countries will be noticed in some of
the South Kensington Museum specimens of English marqueterie, made
at the end of the seventeenth century. The figure work in Holland has
always been of high order, and, although as the seventeenth century
advanced, this perhaps became less refined, the proportions have always
been well preserved, and the attitudes are free and unconstrained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>A very characteristic article of seventeenth century Dutch furniture
is the large and massive wardrobe, with the doors handsomely carved,
not infrequently having three columns, one in the centre and one at each
side, generally forming part of the doors, which are also enriched with
square panels, carved in the centre and finished with mouldings. There
are specimens in the South Kensington Museum of these, and also of
some of earlier Flemish work when the Renaissance was purer in style
and, as has been observed, of less national character.</p>

<p>The marqueterie of this period is extremely rich, the designs are less
severe, but the coloring of the woods is varied, and the effect is heightened
by the addition of small pieces of mother of pearl and ivory. Later,
this marqueterie became florid, badly finished, and the coloring of the
veneers crude and gaudy. Old pieces of plain mahogany furniture were
decorated with a thin layer of highly colored veneering, a meretricious
ornamentation altogether lacking refinement.</p>

<p>There is, however, a peculiarity and character about some of the
furniture of North Holland, in the town of Alkmaar, Hoorn, and others
in this district, which is worth noticing. The treatment has always been
more primitive and quaint than in the Flemish cities to which allusion
has been made&mdash;and it was here that the old farmhouses of the Nord-Hollander
were furnished with the rush-bottomed chairs, painted green;
with three-legged tables, and dower chests painted in flowers and figures
of a rude description; the coloring of which is chiefly green and bright
red, and is extremely effective.</p>

<h5>THE RENAISSANCE IN SPAIN.</h5>

<p>We have seen that Spain, as well as Germany and the Low Countries,
was under the rule of the Emperor Charles V., and therefore it is
unnecessary to look further for the sources of influence which carried
the wave of Renaissance to the Spanish carvers and cabinet makers.</p>

</div>

<p>After Van Eyck was sent for to paint the portrait of King John's
daughter, the Low Countries continued to export to the Peninsula
painters, sculptors, tapestry weavers, and books on Art. French
artists also found employment in Spain, and the older Gothic became
superseded as in other countries. Berruguete, a Spaniard, who had
studied in the atelier of Michael Angelo, returned to his own country
with the new influence strong upon him, and the vast wealth and
resources of Spain at this period of her history enabled her nobles to
indulge their taste in cabinets, richly ornamented with repoussé plaques
of silver, and later of tortoise-shell, of ebony, and of scarce woods from
her Indian possessions; though in a more general way chestnut was still
a favorite medium.</p>

</div>

<p>Contemporaneously with decorative woodwork of Moorish design there
was also a great deal of carving, and of furniture made, after designs
brought from Italy and the North of Europe; and Mr. J. H. Pollen,
quoting a trustworthy Spanish writer, Señor J. F. Riaño, says:&mdash;"The
brilliant epoch of sculpture (in wood) belongs to the sixteenth century, and
was due to the great impulse it received from the works of Berruguete
and Felipe de Borgoñu. He was the chief promoter of the Italian style,
and the choir of the Cathedral of Toledo, where he worked so much,
is the finest specimen of the kind in Spain. Toledo, Seville, and
Valladolid were at the time great productive and artistic centres."</p>

<p>The same writer, after discussing the characteristic Spanish cabinets,
decorated outside with fine ironwork and inside with columns of bone
painted and gilt, which were called "Vargueños," says:&mdash;"The other
cabinets or escritoires belonging to that period (sixteenth century) were to
a large extent imported from Germany and Italy, while others were made
in Spain in imitation of these, and as the copies were very similar it
is difficult to classify them." *   *  *</p>

<p>"Besides these inlaid cabinets, others must have been made in the
sixteenth century inlaid with silver. An Edict was issued in 1594,
prohibiting, with the utmost rigour, the making and selling of this kind
of merchandise, in order not to increase the scarcity of silver." The
Edict says that "no cabinets, desks, coffers, braziers, shoes, tables,
or other articles decorated with stamped, raised, carved, or plain silver
should be manufactured."</p>

<p>The beautiful silver table in His Majesty's collection at Windsor
Castle, illustrated on page <a href="#Page_68">68</a>, is probably one of Spanish make of late
sixteenth or early seventeenth century.</p>

<p>Although not strictly within the period treated of in this chapter,
it is convenient to observe that much later, in the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries, one finds the Spanish cabinet maker ornamenting
his productions with an inlay of ivory let into tortoise-shell, representing
episodes in the history of <em>Don Quichotte</em>, and scenes from the National
pastime of bull-fighting. These cabinets generally have simple rectangular
outlines with numerous drawers, the fronts of which are decorated in
the manner described, and when the stands are original they are formed
of turned legs of ebony or stained wood. In many Spanish cabinets
the influence of Saracenic Art is very dominant; these have generally
a plain exterior, the front is hinged as a fall-down flap, and discloses
a decorative effect which reminds one of some of the Alhambra work&mdash;quaint
arches inlaid with ivory, of a somewhat bizarre coloring of
blue and vermilion&mdash;altogether a rather barbarous but rich and effective
treatment.</p>

<p>To the seventeenth century also belonged the high-backed Spanish
and Portuguese chairs, of dark brown leather, stamped with numerous
figures, birds and floral scrolls, studded with brass nails and ornaments,
while the legs and arms are alone visible as woodwork. They are made
of chestnut, with some leafwork or scroll carving. There is a good
representative woodcut of one of these chairs.</p>

<p>Until Baron Davillier wrote his work on Spanish Art, very little
was known of the various peculiarities by which we can now distinguish
examples of woodwork and furniture of that country from many Italian
or Flemish contemporary productions. Some of the Museum specimens
will assist the reader to mark some of these characteristics, and it may be
observed generally that in the treatment of figure subjects in the carved
work, the attitudes are somewhat strained and, as has been stated, the
outlines of the cabinets are without any special feature. Besides the
Spanish chestnut (noyer), which is singularly lustrous and was much used,
one also finds cedar, cypress wood and pine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Chapel of Saint Bruno, attached to the Carthusian Convent
at Granada, the doors and interior fittings are excellent examples of
inlaid Spanish work of the seventeenth century; the monks of this order
at a somewhat earlier date are said to have produced the "tarsia," or
inlaid work, to which some allusion has already been made.</p>


<h5>THE RENAISSANCE IN GERMANY.</h5>

<p>German Renaissance may be said to have made its debût under
Albrecht Dürer. There was already in many of the German cities a
disposition to copy Flemish artists, but under Dürer's influence this
new departure became developed in a high degree, and, as the sixteenth
century advanced, the Gothic designs of an earlier period were abandoned
in favour of the more free treatment of figure ornament, scrolls, enriched
panels and mouldings, which mark the new era in all Art work.</p>

<p>Many remarkable specimens of German carving are to be met
with in Augsburg, Aschaffenburg, Berlin, Cologne, Dresden, Gotha,
Munich, Manheim, Nuremberg, Ulm, Regensburg, and other old German
towns.</p>

<p>Although made of steel, the celebrated chair at Longford Castle in
Wiltshire is worthy of some notice as a remarkable specimen of German
Renaissance. It is fully described in Richardson's "Studies from Old
English Mansions." It was the work of Thomas Rukers, and was
presented by the city of Augsburg to the Emperor of Germany in 1577.
The city arms are at the back, and also the bust of the Emperor. The
other minute and carefully finished decorative subjects represent various
events in history; a triumphal procession of Cæsar, the Prophet Daniel
explaining his dream, the landing of Æneas, and other events. The
Emperor Rudolphus placed the chair in the City of Prague, Gustavus
Adolphus plundered the city and removed it to Sweden, whence it was
brought by Mr. Gustavus Brander about 100 years ago, and sold by him
to Lord Radnor.</p>

<p>As is the case with Flemish wood-carving, it is often difficult to
identify German work, but its chief characteristics may be described as
an exuberant realism and a fondness for minute detail. M. Bonnaffé has
described this work in a telling phrase: "<em>l'ensemble est tourmenté, laborieux,
touffu tumultueux</em>."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_070.jpg" width="307" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>THE STEEL CHAIR.</p>

<p>At Longford Castle, Wiltshire.</p></div>
</div>

<p>There is a remarkable example of rather late German Renaissance
oak carving in the private chapel of S. Saviour's Hospital, in Osnaburg
Street, Regent's Park, London. The choir stalls, some 31 in number, and
the massive doorway, formed part of a Carthusian monastery at Buxheim,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Bavaria, which was sold and brought to London after the monastery had
been secularised and had passed into the possession of the territorial
landlords, the Bassenheim family. At first intended to ornament one
of the Colleges at Oxford, it was afterwards resold and purchased by the
author, and fitted to the interior of S. Saviour's, and, so far as the
proportions of the chapel would admit of such an arrangement, the relative
positions of the different parts are maintained. The figures of the twelve
apostles&mdash;of David, Eleazer, Moses, Aaron, and of the eighteen saints
at the back of the choir stalls, are marvellous work, and the whole must
have been a harmonious and well-considered arrangement of ornament.
The work, executed by the monks themselves, is said to have been
commenced in 1600, and to have been completed in 1651, and though
a little later than, according to some authorities, the best time of the
Renaissance, is so good a representation of German work of this period
that it will well repay an examination. As the author was responsible for
its arrangement in its present position, he has the permission of the
authorities of S. Saviour's to say that anyone who is interested in Art
will be allowed to see the chapel.</p>

<h5>THE RENAISSANCE IN ENGLAND.</h5>

<p>England under Henry the Eighth was peaceful and prosperous, and
the king was ambitious to outvie his French contemporary, François I.,
in the sumptuousness of his palaces. John of Padua, Holbein, Havernius
of Cleves, and other artists, were induced to come to England and to
introduce the new style. It, however, was of slow growth, and we have
in the mixture of Gothic, Italian, and Flemish ornament, the style which
is known as "Tudor."</p>

<p>It has been well said that "Feudalism was ruined by gunpowder."
The old-fashioned feudal castle was certainly no longer proof against
cannon, and with the new order of things, threatening walls and serried
battlements gave way as if by magic to the pomp and grace of the
Italian mansion. High roofed gables, rows of windows and glittering
oriels looking down on terraced gardens, with vases and fountains, mark
the new epoch.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_072.jpg" width="560" height="301" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>C<span class="smcapa">ARVED</span> O<span class="smcapa">AK</span> C<span class="smcapa">HEST</span> <span class="smcapa">IN</span> <span class="smcapa">THE</span> S<span class="smcapa">TYLE</span> <span class="smcapa">OF</span> H<span class="smcapa">OLBEIN</span>.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The joiner's work plays very important part in the interior
decoration of the castles and country seats of this time, and the roofs
were magnificently timbered with native oak, which was available in longer
lengths than that of foreign growth. The great Hall in Hampton
Court Palace, which was built by Cardinal Wolsey and presented to
his master, the halls of Oxford, and many other public buildings which
remain to us, are examples of fine woodwork in the roofs. Oak
panelling was largely used to line the walls of the great halls, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
"linen scroll pattern" being a favorite form of ornament. This term
describes a panel carved to represent a napkin folded in close convolutions,
and appears to have been adopted from German work; specimens of this
can be seen at Hampton Court, and in old churches decorated in the
early part of the sixteenth century. There is also some fine panelling of
this date in King's College, Cambridge.</p>

<p>In this class of work, which accompanied the style known in architecture
as the "Perpendicular," some of the finest specimens of ornamented
interiors are to be found, that of the roof and choir stalls in the beautiful
Chapel of Henry VII. in Westminster Abbey being world famous. The
carved enrichments of the under parts of the seats, or "misericords," are
remarkably minute, the subjects apparently being taken from old German
engravings. This work was done in England before architecture and
wood carving had altogether flung aside their Gothic trammels, and
shews an admixture of the new Italian style which was afterwards so
generally adopted.</p>

<p>There are in the British Museum some interesting records of contracts
made in the ninth year of Henry VIII.'s reign for joyner's work at
Hengrave, in which the making of "livery" or service cupboards is
specified.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Ye cobards they be made ye facyon of livery y is wᵀᴴout
doors."</p></blockquote>

<p>These were fitted up by the ordinary house carpenters, and consisted
of three stages or shelves standing on four turned legs, with a drawer
for table linen. They were at this period not enclosed, but the mugs
or drinking vessels were hung on hooks, and were taken down and
replaced after use: a ewer and basin was also part of the complement
of a livery cupboard, for cleansing these cups. In Harrison's description
of England in the latter part of the sixteenth century the custom is thus
described:</p>

<p>"Each one as necessitie urgeth, calleth for a cup of such drinke
as him liketh, so when he hath tasted it, he delivereth the cup again
to some one of the standers by, who maketh it clean by pouring out
the drinke that remaineth, restoreth it to the cupboard from whence he
fetched the same."</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind, in considering the furniture of the
earlier part of the sixteenth century, that the religious persecutions of
the time, together with the general break up of the feudal system, had
gradually brought about the disuse of the old custom of the master of
the house taking his meals in the large hall or "houseplace," together
with his retainers and dependants; and a smaller room leading from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the great hall was fitted up with a "dressoir" or "service cupboard,"
for the drinking vessels in the manner just described, with a bedstead,
and a chair, some benches, and the board on trestles, which
formed the table of the period. This room, called a "parler" or
"privee parloir," was the part of the house where the family enjoyed
domestic life, and it is a singular fact that the Clerics of the time,
and also the Court party, saw in this tendency towards private life
so grave an objection that, in 1526, this change in fashion was the
subject of a Court ordinance, and also of a special Pastoral from
Bishop Grosbeste. The text runs thus: "Sundrie noblemen and
gentlemen and others doe much delighte to dyne in corners and secret
places," and the reason given, was that it was a bad influence, dividing
class from class; the real reason was probably that by more private
and domestic life, the power of the Church over her members was
weakened.</p>

<p>In spite, however, of opposition in high places, the custom of using
the smaller rooms became more common, and we shall find the furniture,
as time goes on, designed accordingly.</p>

<p>(<em>Described below.</em>)</p></div>
</div>

<p>In the South Kensington Museum there is a very remarkable
cabinet, the decoration of which points to its being made in England
at this time&mdash;that is, about the middle, or during the latter half of the
sixteenth century; but the highly finished and intricate marqueterie and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
carving would seem to prove that Italian or German craftsmen had
executed the work. It should be carefully examined as a very interesting
specimen. The Tudor arms, the rose and portcullis, are inlaid on the
stand. The arched panels in the folding doors and at the ends of
the cabinet are in high relief, representing battle scenes, and bear
some resemblance to Holbein's style. The general arrangement of
the design reminds one of a Roman triumphal arch. The woods
employed are chiefly pear tree, inlaid with coromandel and other woods.
Its height is 4ft. 7in. and width 3ft. 1in., but there is in it an
immense amount of careful detail which could only be the work of
the most skilful craftsmen of the day, and it was evidently intended
for a room of moderate dimensions where the intricacies of design
could be observed. Mr. Hungerford Pollen has described this cabinet
fully, giving the subjects of the ornament, the Latin mottoes and
inscriptions, and other details, which occupy over four closely-printed
pages of his Museum catalogue. It cost the nation £500, and was a
very judicious purchase.</p>

<p>Chairs were during the first half of the sixteenth century very
scarce articles, and, as we have seen with other countries, only used
for the master or mistress of the house. The chair which is said to
have belonged to Anna Boleyn, of which an illustration is given on page <a href="#Page_74">74</a>,
is from the collection of the late Mr. Geo. Godwin, F.S.A., formerly
editor of "<em>The Builder</em>," and was part of the contents of Hever Castle,
in Kent. It is of carved oak, inlaid with ebony and boxwood, and was
probably made by an Italian workman. "Settles" were largely used, and
both these and such chairs as then existed, were dependent, for richness
of effect, upon the loose cushions with which they were furnished.</p>

<p>If we attempt to gain a knowledge of the designs of the tables of the
sixteenth, and the early part of the seventeenth centuries, from interiors
represented in paintings of this period, the visit to the picture gallery
will be almost in vain, for in nearly every case the table is covered
by a cloth. As these cloths or "carpets," as they were then termed,
to distinguish them from the "tapet" or floor covering, often cost far
more than the articles they covered, a word about them may be
allowed.</p>

<p>Most of the old inventories from 1590, after mentioning the "framed"
or "joyned" table, name the "carpett of Turky werke" which covered
it, and in many cases there was still another covering to protect the best
one, and when Frederick, Duke of Wurtemburg, visited England in 1592,
he noted a very extravagant "carpett" at Hampton Court, which was
embroidered with pearls and cost 50,000 crowns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>The cushions or "quysshens" for the chairs, of embroidered velvet,
were also very important appendages to the otherwise hard oaken and
ebony seats, and as the actual date of the will of Alderman Glasseor
quoted below is 1589, we may gather from the extract given, something
of the character and value of these ornamental accessories which
would probably have been in use for some five and twenty or thirty
years previously.</p>

<p>"Inventory of the contents of the parler of St. Jones, within the
cittie of Chester," of which place Alderman Glasseor was vice-chamberlain:&mdash;</p>

<ul class="index">
<li>"A drawinge table of joyned work with a frame", valued at "xl shillings," equilius Labour £20 your present money.</li>

<li>And others of velvet "embroidered wt gold and silver armes in the middesle."</li>
<li>Eight pictures xl<em>s.</em> Maps, a pedigree of Earl Leicester in "joyned frame" and a list of books.</li>
</ul>


<p>This Alderman Glasseor was apparently a man of taste and culture
for those days; he had "casting bottles" of silver for sprinkling perfumes
after dinner, and he also had a country house "at the sea," where
his parlour was furnished with a "canapy bedd."</p>

<p>As the century advances, and we get well into Elizabeth's reign,
wood carving becomes more ambitious, and although it is impossible to
distinguish the work of Flemish carvers who had settled in England
from that of our native craftsmen, these doubtless had acquired from the
former much of their skill. In the costumes and in the faces of figures
or busts, produced in the highly ornamental oak chimney pieces of the
time, or in the carved portions of the fourpost bedsteads, the national
characteristics are preserved, and, with a certain grotesqueness introduced
into the treatment of accessories, combine to distinguish the English
school of Elizabethan ornament from other contemporary work.</p>

<p>Knole, Longleat, Burleigh, Hatfield, Hardwick, and Audley End are
familiar instances of the change in interior decoration which accompanied
that in architecture; terminal figures, that is, pedestals diminishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
towards their bases, surmounted by busts of men or women, elaborate
interlaced strap work carved in low relief, trophies of fruit and flowers,
take the places of the more Gothic treatment formerly in vogue. The
change in the design of furniture naturally followed, for when Flemish
or Italian carvers were not employed, the actual execution was often by
the hand of the house carpenter, who was influenced by what he saw
around him.</p>

<p>The great chimney-piece in Speke Hall, near Liverpool, portions of
the staircase of Hatfield, and of other English mansions before mentioned,
are good examples of the wood carving of this period, and the illustrations
from authenticated examples which are given will assist the reader to
follow these remarks.</p>

<p>(<em>In the Palace of the Bishop of Bath and Wells.</em>)</p></div>
</div>

<p>There is a mirror frame at Goodrich Court of early Elizabethan
work, carved in oak and partly gilt; the design is in the best style
of Renaissance, and more like Italian or French, than English work.
Architectural mouldings, wreaths of flowers, cupids, and an allegorical
figure of Faith are harmoniously combined in the design, the size of
the whole frame being 4ft. 5ins. by 3ft. 6ins. It bears the initials
R.M., and is dated 1359, the year in which Roland Meyrick became
Bishop of Bangor; it is still in the possession of the Meyrick family.
A careful drawing of this frame was made by Henry Shaw, F.S.A.,
and published in "Specimens of Ancient Furniture drawn from existing
Authorities," in 1836. This valuable work of reference also contains finished
drawings of other noteworthy examples of the sixteenth century furniture
and woodwork. Amongst these is one of the Abbot's chair at Glastonbury,
temp. Henry VIII., the original of the chair familiar to us now in the
chancel of most churches; also a chair in the State-room of Hardwick Hall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Derbyshire, covered with crimson velvet embroidered with silver tissue,
and others, very interesting to refer to because the illustrations are all
drawn from the articles themselves, and their descriptions are written
by an excellent antiquarian and collector, Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick.</p>

<p>The mirror frame just described was probably one of the first of
its size and kind in England. It was the custom, as has been already
stated, to paint the walls with subjects from history or Scripture, and
there are many precepts in existence from early times until about the
beginning of Henry VIII.'s reign, directing how certain walls were to be
decorated. The discontinuance of this fashion brought about the framing
of pictures, and some of the paintings by Holbein, who came to this
country about 1511, and received the patronage of Henry VIII. some
fourteen or fifteen years later, are probably the first pictures that were
framed in England. There are some two or three of these at Hampton
Court Palace, the ornament being a scroll in gold on a black background,
the width of the frame very small in comparison with its canvas. Some
of the old wall paintings were on a small scale, and, where long stories
were represented, the subjects, instead of occupying the whole flank of the
wall, had been divided into rows some three feet or less in height, these
being separated by battens, and therefore the first frames would appear to
be really little more than the addition of vertical sides to the horizontal
top and bottom which such battens had formed. Subsequently, frames
became more ornate and elaborate. After their application to pictures,
their use for mirrors was but a step in advance, and the mirror in a
carved and gilt or decorated frame, probably at first imported and
afterwards copied, came to replace the older mirror of very small
dimensions which had been used for toilet purposes.</p>

<p>Until early in the fifteenth century, mirrors of polished steel in the
antique style, framed in silver and ivory, had been used; in the wardrobe
account of Edward I. the item occurs: "A comb and a mirror of silver
gilt," and we have an extract from the privy purse of expenses of
Henry VIII. which mentions the payment "to a Frenchman for certayne
loking glasses," which would probably be a novelty then brought to his
Majesty's notice.</p>

<p>Indeed, there was no glass used for windows<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> previous to the
fifteenth century, the substitute being shaved horn, parchment, and sometimes
mica, let into the shutters which enclosed the window opening.</p>

<p>The oak panelling of rooms during the reign of Elizabeth was very
handsome, and in the example at South Kensington, of which there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
here an illustration, the country possesses a very excellent representative
specimen. This was removed from an old house at Exeter, and its date
is given by Mr. Hungerford Pollen as from 1550-75. The pilasters and
carved panels under the cornice are very rich, and in the best style of
Elizabethan Renaissance, while the panels themselves, being plain, afford
repose, and bring the ornament into relief. The entire length is 52ft.,
and average height 8ft. 3in. If this panelling could be arranged as it
was fitted originally in the house of one of Elizabeth's subjects, with
models of fireplace, moulded ceiling, and accessories added, we should
then have an object lesson of value, and be able to picture a Drake or a
Raleigh in his West of England home.</p>

</div>

<p>A later purchase by the Science and Art Department, which was
added to the Museum in 1891 for the extremely moderate price of £1,000,
is the panelling of a room some 23ft. square and 12ft. 6in. high, from
Sizergh Castle, Westmoreland. The chimney piece was unfortunately
not purchased, but the Department has arranged the panelling as a room
with a plaster model of the extremely handsome ceiling. The panelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
is of richly figured oak, entirely devoid of polish, and is inlaid with black
bog oak and holly, in geometrical designs, being divided at intervals by tall
pilasters with flutings of bog oak and having Ionic capitals. The work
was probably done locally, and from wood grown on the estate, and is
one of the most remarkable examples in existence. The date is about
1560 to 1570, and it has been described in local literature as of nearly
200 years' age.</p>

</div>

<p>While we are on the subject of panelling, it may be worth while
to point out that with regard to old English work of this date, one may
safely take it for granted that where, as in the South Kensington (Exeter)
example, the pilasters, frieze, and frame-work are enriched, and the panels
plain, the work was designed and made for the house, but when the
panels are carved and the rest plain, they were bought, and then fitted
up by the local carpenter.</p>

<p>Another Museum specimen of Elizabethan carved oak is a fourpost
bedstead, with the arms of the Countess of Devon, which bears date
1593, and has all the characteristics of the time.</p>

<p>There is also a good example of Elizabethan woodwork in part
of the interior of the Charterhouse, immortalised by Thackeray, when,
as "Greyfriars," in the "Newcomes," he described it as the old school
"where the colonel, and Clive, and I were brought up", and it was
here that, as a "poor brother," the old colonel had returned to spend
the evening of his gentle life, and, to quote Thackeray's pathetic lines,
"when the chapel bell began to toll, he lifted up his head a little, and said
'Adsum!' It was the word we used at school when names were called."</p>

<p>This famous relic of old London, which fortunately escaped the
Great Fire in 1666, was formerly an old monastery, which Henry VIII.
dissolved in 1537, and the house was given some few years later to
Sir Edward, afterwards Lord North, from whom the Duke of Norfolk
purchased it in 1565, and the handsome staircase, carved with terminal
figures and Renaissance ornament, was probably built either by Lord
North or his successor. The woodwork of the Great Hall, where the
pensioners still dine every day, is very rich, the fluted columns with
Corinthian capitals, the interlaced strap work, and other details of
carved oak, are characteristic of the best sixteenth century woodwork
in England; the shield bears the date of 1571. This was the year
when the Duke of Norfolk, who was afterwards beheaded, was released
from the Tower on a kind of furlough, and probably amused himself
with the enrichment of his mansion, then called Howard House. In
the old Governors' room, formerly the drawing room of the Howards,
there is a specimen of the large wooden chimney-piece of the end of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
sixteenth century, painted instead of carved. After the Duke of Norfolk's
death, the house was granted by the Crown to his son, the Earl of
Suffolk, who sold it in 1611 to the founder of the present hospital,
Sir Thomas Sutton, a citizen who is reputed to be one of the wealthiest
of his time. Some of the furniture given by him will be found noticed
in the chapter on the Jacobean period.</p>

<p>Shewing Tables and Benches.</p></div>
</div>

<p>There are in London other excellent examples of Elizabethan oak
carving. Amongst those easily accessible and valuable for reference, are
the Hall of Gray's Inn, built in 1560, the second year of the Queen's
reign, and Middle Temple Hall, built in 1570-2. By permission of
Mr. William R. Douthwaite, librarian of "Gray's Inn," and author of
"Gray's Inn, its History and Associations," we are enabled to give
illustrations of the interior of the Hall, and also of the carved screen
supporting the Minstrels' Gallery. The interlaced strap work, generally
found in Elizabethan carving, encircles the shafts of the columns as a
decoration. The table in the centre has also some low relief carving
on the drawer front which forms its frieze, but the straight and severe
style of leg leads us to place its date at some fifty years later than the
Hall. The desk on the left, and the table on the right, are probably
of a still later period. It may be mentioned here, too, that the long
table which stands at the opposite end of the Hall, on the daïs, said to
have been presented by Queen Elizabeth, is not of the design with which
the furniture of her reign is associated by experts; the heavy cabriole
legs, with bent knees, corresponding with the legs of the chairs (also on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
the daïs) are of unmistakable Dutch origin, and so far as the writer's
observations and investigations have gone, were probably introduced into
England about the time of William III.</p>

<p>The same remarks apply to a table in Middle Temple Hall, also said
to have been there during Elizabeth's time. Mr. Douthwaite alludes
to the rumour of the Queen's gift in his book, and endeavoured to
substantiate it from records at his command, but in vain. The authorities
at Middle Temple are also, so far as we have been able to ascertain,
without any documentary evidence to prove the claim of their table to
any greater age than the end of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>The carved oak screen of Middle Temple Hall is magnificent, and no
one should miss seeing it. Terminal figures, fluted columns, panels
broken up into smaller divisions, and carved enrichments of various
devices, are all combined in a harmonious design, rich without being
overcrowded, and its effect is enhanced by the rich color given to it by
age, by the excellent proportions of the Hall, by the plain panelling of
the three other sides, and above all by the grand oak roof, which is
certainly one of the finest of its kind in England. Some of the tables
and forms are of a much later date, but an interest attaches even to this
furniture from the fact of its having been made from oak grown close to
the Hall; and as one of the tables has a slab composed of an oak plank
nearly thirty inches wide, we can imagine what fine old trees once grew
and flourished close to the now busy Fleet Street, and the bustling
Strand. There are frames, too, in Middle Temple made from the oaken
timbers which once formed the piles in the Thames on which rested
"the Temple Stairs."</p>

<p>In Mr. Herbert's "Antiquities of the Inns of Court and Chancery,"
there are several facts of interest in connection with the woodwork of
Middle Temple. He mentions that the screen was paid for by contributions
from each bencher of twenty shillings, each barrister of ten shillings,
and every other member of six shillings and eightpence; that the Hall
was founded in 1562, and furnished ten years later, the screen being
put up in 1574; and that the memorials of some two hundred and fifty
"Readers" which decorate the otherwise plain oak panelling, date from
1597 to 1804, the year in which Mr. Herbert's book was published.
Referring to the furniture, he says:&mdash;"The massy oak tables and benches
with which this apartment was anciently furnished, still remain, and so
may do for centuries, unless violently destroyed, being of wonderful
strength." Mr. Herbert also mentions the masks and revels held in this
famous Hall in the time of Elizabeth: he also gives a list of quantities
and prices of materials used in the decoration of Gray's Inn Hall.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Hall of the Carpenters' Company, in Throgmorton Avenue,
are three curious carved oak panels, worth noticing here, as they are
of a date bringing them well into this period. They were formerly in
the old Hall, which escaped the Great Fire, and in the account books
of the Corporation is the following record of the cost of one of these
panels:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Paide for a planke to carve the arms of the Companie <span class="mleft3d">&nbsp;</span>iijs."</div>
  <div class="i0">"Paide to the Carver for carving the arms of the Companie  <span class="mleft2">&nbsp;</span>xxiijs. iiijd."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The price of material (3s.) and workmanship (23s. 4d.) was certainly
not excessive. All three panels are in excellent preservation, and the
design of a harp, being a rebus of the Master's name, is a quaint relic of
old customs. Some other oak furniture, in the Hall of this ancient
Company, will be noticed in the following chapter. Mr. Jupp, a former
Clerk of the Company, has written an historical account of the
"Carpenters," which contains many facts of interest. The office of King's
Carpenter or Surveyor, the powers of the Carpenters to search, examine,
and impose fines for inefficient work, and the trade disputes with the
"Joyners," the "Sawyers," and the "Woodmongers," are all entertaining
reading, and throw many side-lights on the woodwork of the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries.</p>

<p>The illustration of Hardwick Hall shews oak panelling and decoration
of a somewhat earlier, and also somewhat later, time than Elizabeth, while
the carved oak chairs are of Jacobean style. At Hardwick is still kept
the historic chair in which it is said that William, fourth Earl of
Devonshire, sat when he and his friends compassed the downfall of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
James II. In the curious little chapel, hung with ancient tapestry, and
containing the original Bible and Prayer Book of Charles I., are other
quaint chairs covered with cushions of sixteenth or early seventeenth
century needlework.</p>

<p>Before concluding the remarks on this period of English woodwork
and furniture, further mention should be made of Penshurst Place, to
which there has been already some reference in the chapter on the period
of the Middle Ages. It was here that Sir Philip Sydney spent much of
his time, and produced his best literary work, during the period of his
retirement when he had lost the favour of Elizabeth: and in the room known
as the "Queen's Room," illustrated on page <a href="#Page_89">89</a>, some of the furniture
is of this period. The crystal chandeliers are said to have been given
by Leicester to his Royal Mistress, and some of the chairs and tables
were sent down by the Queen, and presented to Sir Henry Sydney
(Philip's father) when she stayed at Penshurst during one of her Royal
progresses. The room, with its vases and bowls of old Oriental china
and the contemporary portraits on the walls, gives us a good idea of the
very best effect that was attainable with the material then available.</p>

<p>Richardson's "Studies" contains, amongst other examples of furniture,
and carved oak decorations of English Renaissance, interiors of Little
Charlton, East Sutton Place, Stockton House, Wilts, Audley End, Essex,
and the Great Hall, Crewe, with its beautiful hall screens and famous
carved "parloir," all notable mansions of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>To this period of English furniture belongs the celebrated "Great
Bed of Ware," of which there is an illustration. This was formerly at
the "Saracen's Head" at Ware, but has been removed to Rye House,
about two miles away. Shakespeare's allusion to it in the "Twelfth
Night" has identified the approximate date and gives the bed a character.
The following are the lines:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>S<span class="smcapa">IR</span> T<span class="smcapa">OBY</span> B<span class="smcapa">ELCH</span>.&mdash;And as many lies as shall lie in thy sheet of paper
altho' the sheet were big enough for the Bed of Ware in England, set em down,
go about it.</p></blockquote>

<p>Another illustration shews the chair which is said to have belonged
to William Shakespeare: it may or may not be the actual one used
by the poet, but it is most probably a genuine specimen of about his
time, though perhaps not made in England. There is a manuscript
on its back which states that it was known in 1769 as the Shakespeare
Chair, when Garrick borrowed it from its owner, Mr. James Bacon, of
Barnet, and since that time its history is well known. The carved
ornament is in low relief, and represents a rough idea of the dome of
S. Marc and the Campanile Tower.</p>

<p>We have now briefly and roughly traced the advance of what may
be termed the flood-tide of Art from its birthplace in Italy to France,
the Netherlands, Spain, Germany, and England; and by explanation and
description, assisted by illustrations, have endeavoured to show how the
Gothic of the latter part of the Middle Ages gave way before the
revival of classic forms and arabesque ornament, with the many details
and peculiarities characteristic of each different nationality which had
adopted the general change. During this period the "bahut" or chest has
become a cabinet with all its varieties; the simple <em>prie dieu</em> chair, as a
devotional piece of furniture, has been elaborated into almost an oratory,
and, as a domestic seat, into a dignified throne; tables have, towards
the end of the period, become more ornate, and made as solid pieces
of furniture, instead of the planks and tressels which we found when the
Renaissance commenced. Chimney pieces, which in the fourteenth century
were merely stone smoke shafts or hoods supported by corbels, have been
replaced by handsome carved oak erections, ornamenting the hall or room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
from floor to ceiling, and the English livery cupboard, with its foreign
contemporary the buffet, is the forerunner of the sideboard of the future.</p>

<p>Carved oak panelling has replaced the old arras and ruder wood
lining of an earlier time, and with the departure of the old feudal customs
and the indulgence in greater luxuries of the more wealthy nobles and
merchants in Italy, Flanders, France, Germany, Spain, and England, we
have the elegances and grace with which Art, and increased means of
gratifying taste, enabled the sixteenth century virtuoso to adorn his
home.</p>

<p><span class="figleft100"><img src="images/i_091.jpg" width="126" height="250" alt="I" /></span>N the chapter on "Renaissance" the great Art
revival in England has been noticed; in the
Elizabethan oak work of chimney pieces, panelling,
and furniture, are to be found varying forms of
the free classic style which the Renaissance had
brought about. These fluctuating changes in
fashion continued in England from the time of
Elizabeth until the middle of the eighteenth
century, when, as will be shewn presently, a
distinct alteration in the design of furniture took
place.</p>

<p>The domestic habits of Englishmen were
getting more established. We have seen how
religious persecution during preceding reigns, at
the time of the Reformation, had encouraged
private domestic life of families in the smaller
rooms and apart from the gossiping retainer,
who might at any time bring destruction upon the
household by giving information about items of conversation he had overheard.
There is a quaint passage in one of Sir Henry Wotton's letters,
written in 1600, which shews that this home life was now becoming a
settled characteristic of his countrymen.</p>

<p>"Every man's proper mansion house and home, being the theatre
of his hospitality, the seate of his selfe fruition, the comfortable part
of his own life, the noblest of his son's inheritance, a kind of private
princedom, nay the possession thereof an epitome of the whole world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
well deserve by these attributes, according to the degree of the
master, to be delightfully adorned."</p>

<p>Sir Henry Wotton was Ambassador in Venice in 1604, and is said
to have been the author of the well-known definition of an ambassador's
calling, namely, "an honest man sent to lie abroad for his country's
good." This offended the piety of James I., and caused him for some time
to be in disgrace. He also published, some 20 years later, "Elements of
Architecture," and being an antiquarian and man of taste, sent home
many specimens of the famous Italian wood carving.</p>

<p>It was during the reign of James I. and that of his successor that
Inigo Jones, our English Vitruvius, was making his great reputation; he
had returned from Italy full of enthusiasm for the Renaissance of Palladio
and his school, and of knowledge and taste gained by a diligent study<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
of the ancient classic buildings of Rome. His influence would be
speedily felt in the design of woodwork fittings, for the interiors of his
edifices. There is a note in his own copy of Palladio, which is now
in the library of Worcester College, Oxford, which is worth quoting:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the name of God: Amen. The 2 of January, 1614, I being in Rome compared
these desines following, with the Ruines themselves.&mdash;I<span class="smcapa">NIGO</span> J<span class="smcapa">ONES</span>."</p></blockquote>

<p>In the following year he returned from Italy on his appointment
as King's Surveyor of Works, and until his death in 1652 was full of
work, although unfortunately for us, much that he designed was never
carried out, and much that he carried out has been destroyed by
fire. The Banqueting Hall of Whitehall, now Whitehall Chapel; St.
Paul's, Covent Garden; the old water gate originally intended as the
entrance to the first Duke of Buckingham's Palace, close to Charing
Cross; Nos. 55 and 56, on the south side of Great Queen Street,
Lincoln's Inn; and one or two monuments and porches, are amongst the
examples that remain to us of this great master's work; and of interiors,
that of Ashburnham House is left to remind us, with its quiet dignity of
style, of this great master. It has been said in speaking of the staircase,
plaster ornament, and woodwork of this interior, "upon the whole is set
the seal of the time of Charles I." As the work was probably finished
during the King's reign, the impression intended to be conveyed was
that after wood carving had rather run riot towards the end of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
sixteenth century, we had now in the interior designed by Inigo Jones,
or influenced by his school, a more quiet and sober style.</p>

<p>The above woodcut shews a portion of the King's room, in Ford
Castle, which still contains souvenirs of Flodden Field&mdash;according to an
article in the <em>Magazine of Art</em>. The room is in the northernmost tower,
which still preserves externally the stern, grim character of the border
fortress; and the room looks towards the famous battle-field. The chair
shews a date 1638, and there is another of Dutch design of about fifty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
or sixty years later; but the carved oak bedstead, with tapestry hangings,
and the oak press, which the writer of the article mentions as forming
part of the old furniture of the room, scarcely appear in the illustration.</p>

<p>Mr. Hungerford Pollen tells us that the majority of so-called Tudor
houses were actually built during the reign of James I., and this may
probably be accepted as an explanation of the otherwise curious fact
of there being much in the architecture and woodwork of this time which
would seem to belong to the earlier period.</p>

<p>The illustrations of wooden chimney pieces will shew this change.
There are in the South Kensington Museum some three or four chimney
pieces of stone, having the upper portions of carved oak, the dates of which
have been ascertained to be about 1620; these were removed from an old
house in Lime Street, City, and give us an idea of the interior decoration
of a residence of a London merchant. The one illustrated is somewhat
richer than the others, the columns supporting the cornice of
the others being almost plain pillars with Ionic or Doric capitals, and the
carving of the panels of all of them is in less relief, and simpler in
character, than those which occur in the latter part of Elizabeth's time.</p>

<p><em>In the Hall of the Carpenters' Company.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>The earliest dated piece of Jacobean furniture which has come under
the writer's observation is the octagonal table belonging to the Carpenters'
Company. The illustration, taken from Mr. Jupp's book referred to in
the last chapter, hardly does the table justice; it is really a very
handsome piece of furniture, and measures about 3 feet 3 inches in
diameter. In the spandrils of the arches between the legs are the
letters R.W., G.I., J.R., and W.W., being the initials of Richard Wyatt,
George Isack, John Reeve, and William Willson, who were Master and
Wardens of the Company in 1606, which date is carved in two of the
spandrils. While the ornamental legs shew some of the characteristics
of Elizabethan work, the treatment is less bold, the large acorn-shaped
member has become more refined and attenuated, and the ornament is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
altogether more subdued. This is a remarkable specimen of early
Jacobean furniture, and is the only one of the shape and kind known to
the writer; it is in excellent preservation, save that the top is split. It
shews signs of having been made with considerable skill and care.</p>

is taken from this source, the album having been placed at the writer's
disposal by the courtesy of Mr. Jones, of the Photographic Department.

<p>In the Hall of the Barbers' Company in Monkswell Street, the Court
room, which is lighted with an octagonal cupola, was designed by Inigo
Jones as a Theatre of Anatomy, when the Barbers and Surgeons were one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
corporation. There are some three or four tables of this period in the
Hall, having four legs connected by stretchers, quite plain; the moulded
edges of the table tops are also without enrichment. These plain oak
slabs, and also the stretchers, have been renewed, but in exactly the same
style as the original work; the legs, however, are the old ones, and are
simple columns with plain turned capitals and bases. Other tables of this
period are to be found in a few old country mansions; there is one in
Longleat, which, the writer has been told, has a small drawer at the end,
to hold the copper coins with which the retainers of the Marquis of
Bath's ancestors used to play a game of shovel penny. In the Chapter
House in Westminster Abbey, there is also one of these plain substantial
James I. tables, which is singular in being nearly double the width of
those which were usually made at this time. As the Chapter House was,
until comparatively recent years, used as a room for the storage of
records, this table was probably made, not as a dining table, but for
some other purpose requiring greater width.</p>

<p>In the chapter on Renaissance there was an allusion to Charterhouse,
which was purchased for its present purpose by Thomas Sutton in 1611,
and in the chapel may be seen to-day the original communion table
placed there by the founder. It is of carved oak, with a row of legs
running lengthways underneath the middle, and four others at the corners;
these, while being cast in the simple lines already noticed in describing
the tables in the Barbers' Hall, and the Chapter House, Westminster
Abbey, are enriched by carving from the base, to the third of the height of
the leg, and the frieze of the table is also carved in low relief. The rich
carved wood screen which supports the organ loft is also of Jacobean work.</p>

<p>There is in the South Kensington Museum a carved oak chest, with a
centre panel representing the Adoration of the Magi, of about this date,
1615-20; it is mounted on a stand which has three feet in front and two
behind, which are much more primitive and quaint than the ornate
supports of Elizabethan carving; while the only ornaments on the drawer
fronts which form the frieze of the stand are moulded panels, in the
centre of each of which there is a turned knob by which to open the
drawer. This chest and the table which forms its stand were probably not
intended for each other. The illustration on the previous page shews the
stand, which is a good representation of the carving of this time, <em>i.e.</em>, early
seventeenth century. The round-backed arm chair which the Museum
purchased in 1891 from the Hailstone Collection, though dated 1614, is
really more Elizabethan in design than one would expect.</p>

<p>There is no greater storehouse for specimens of furniture in use
during the Jacobean period than Knole, that stately mansion of the
Sackville family, then the property of the Earls of Dorset. In the
King's Bedroom, which is said to have been specially prepared and
furnished for the visit of King James I., the public, owing to the
courtesy and generous spirit of the present Lord Sackville, can still
see the bed, originally of crimson silk, but now much faded, elaborately
embroidered with gold. It is said to have cost £8,000, and the chairs
and seats, which are believed to have formed part of the original
equipment of the room, are in much the same position as they then
occupied.</p>

<p>In the carved work of this furniture we cannot help thinking that the
hand of the Venetian craftsman is to be traced, and it is probable that they
were either imported or copied from a pattern brought over for that
purpose. A suite of furniture of that time appears to have consisted of
six stools and two arm chairs, almost entirely covered with velvet, having
the "<img src="images/i_098.png" width="21" height="22" alt="" />" form supports, which, so far as the writer's investigations have
gone, appear to have come from Venice. In the "Leicester" gallery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
at Knole there is a portrait of the King, painted by Mytens, seated on
such a chair, and just below the picture is placed the chair which is
said to be identical with the one portrayed. It is similar to the one
reproduced on page <a href="#Page_100">100</a> from a drawing of Mr. Charles Eastlake's.</p>

<p>This excellent example of Jacobean furniture has been described and
sketched by Mr. Charles Eastlake in "Hints on Household Taste." He
says: "The joints are properly 'tenoned' and pinned together in such a
manner as to ensure its constant stability. The back is formed like that
of a chair, with a horizontal rail only at its upper edge, but it receives
additional strength from the second rail, which is introduced at the back
of the seat." In Marcus Stone's well-known picture of "The Stolen
Keys," this is the sofa portrayed. The arm chair illustrated above is part
of the same suite of furniture. The furniture of another room at Knole
is said to have been presented by King James to the first Earl of
Middlesex, who had married into the Dorset family. The author has
been furnished with a photograph of this room; and the illustration
prepared from this will give the reader a better idea than a lengthy
description.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>It seems from a comparison of the Knole furniture with the designs
of some of the tables and other woodwork produced during the same
reign, bearing the impress of the more severe style of Inigo Jones, that
there were then in England two styles of decorative furniture. One of
these, simple and severe, shewing a reaction from the grotesque freedom
of Elizabethan carving, and the other, copied from Venetian ornamental
woodwork, with cupids on scrolls forming the supports of stools, having
these ornamental legs connected by stretchers, the design of which is, in
the case of those in the King's Bedchamber at Knole, a couple of cupids
in a flying attitude holding up a crown. This kind of furniture was
generally gilt, and under the black paint of those at Knole, traces of
the gold are still to be seen.</p>

<p>Mr. Eastlake visited Knole, and made a careful examination and
sketches of the Jacobean furniture there, and has well described and
illustrated it in his book just referred to; he mentions that he found
there a slip of paper tucked beneath the webbing of a settle, with an
inscription in Old English characters which fixed the date of some of the
furniture at 1620. Mr. Lionel Sackville West has confirmed this date in
a letter to the author, by a reference to the heirloom book, which also
bears out the author's opinion that some of the more richly-carved furniture
of this time was imported from Italy.</p>

<p>In the Lady Chapel of Canterbury Cathedral there is a monument
of Dean Boys, who died in 1625. This represents the Dean seated in his
library, at a table with turned legs, over which there is a tapestry cover.
Books line the walls of the section of the room shewn in the stone
carving; it differs little from the sanctum of a literary man of the present
day. There are many other monuments which represent furniture of this
period, and amongst the more curious is that of a child of King James I.,
in Westminster Abbey, close to the monument of Mary Queen of Scots.
The child is sculptured about life size, in a carved cradle of the time.</p>

<p>Holland House, Kensington, is a good example of a Jacobean
mansion. The chief interest, inseparable from this house, is, of course,
associated with the memory of the third Lord Holland, "nephew
of Fox and friend of Grey," who gathered around him within its
walls the most brilliant and distinguished society of the day, presiding
over it with that genial courtesy which was the rich inheritance of his
family.</p>

<p>Macaulay, at the conclusion of his essay on Lord Holland, has, with
his unrivalled power of description, told us of the charm and fascination
of "that circle in which every talent and accomplishment, every art and
science, had its place"&mdash;enumerating also the names of many of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
who formed it, and expatiating on "the grace and the kindness, far more
admirable than grace, with which the princely hospitality of that ancient
mansion was dispensed." Princess Liechtenstein has also preserved for
us, in "Holland House," a charming record of many of the historical
associations of this famous old place.</p>

<p>There are in the house also many objects of great interest, of various
periods, which, by the courtesy of Lady Ilchester, the writer has been
allowed to examine. Our business, however, is with the 17th century,
and we must now return to a consideration of the furniture and woodwork
of that time.</p>

<p>The Holland House of the time of James I. was commenced in the
year 1607, as "Cope Castle," by Sir Walter Cope, who then owned the
extensive "Manor" of Kensington. Cope's daughter married Sir Henry
Rich, who became Earl of Holland in 1624, and was executed by the
Parliamentarians in 1649. He it was who added to the house the wings
and arcades. Princess Liechtenstein tells us the story of "the solitary
ghost of its first lord, who, according to tradition, issues forth at
midnight from behind a secret door, and walks slowly through the scenes
of his former triumph with his head in his hand."</p>

<p>There is some good old woodwork of the early part of the
seventeenth century, and the panelling and chimney piece of the
famous "white parlour" are of the times of James I., the work, still in
good preservation, being in the best Jacobean taste. The panels are
formed by bold uncarved mouldings, separated at intervals by flat
pilasters with fluted shafts and carved capitals; the panels in the frieze,
between the trusses, which support a "dentilled" cornice, are enriched
with fretwork ornaments in relief, and the whole has a simple but
decorative architectural effect of the best English rendering of the
Renaissance. The "gilt room," where the ghost is said to commence its
nocturnal promenade, was decorated by Francesco Cleyn, an Italian,
who also worked for the King.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The room was prepared for a ball
which was purposed to be given in honor of the marriage of Prince
Charles to Henrietta Maria. There are now on the chief staircase of
Holland House, two chairs with their backs carved as shells, and with
legs shaped and ornamented with scrollwork, and masks with swags
of foliage, which are also attributed to Cleyn. Horace Walpole,
in a reference to Holland House, has mentioned these chairs in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
"Anecdotes of Painters." "Two chairs, carved and gilt, with large shells
for backs ... were undoubtedly from his designs, and are evidences
of his taste." Walpole also mentions a garden seat of similar design
by Cleyn. A drawing of one of these chairs forms the tail piece of this
chapter.</p>

<p>There is another Jacobean house of considerable interest, the property
of Mr. T. G. Jackson, A.R.A. An account of it has been written by him,
and was read to some members of the Surrey Archæological Society, who
visited Eagle House, Wimbledon, in 1890. It appears to have been the
country seat of a London merchant, who lived early in the seventeenth
century. Mr. Jackson bears witness to the excellence of the workmanship,
and expresses his opinion that the carved and decorated enrichments were
executed by native and not by foreign craftsmen. He gives an illustration
in his pamphlet of the sunk "Strap Work," which, though Jacobean in
its date, is also found in the carved ornament of Elizabeth's time.</p>

<p>It is very probable that had the reign of Charles I. been less
troublous, this would have been a time of much progress in the domestic
arts in England. The Queen was of the Medici family, Italian literature
was in vogue, and Italian artists therefore would probably have been
encouraged to come over and instruct our workmen. The King himself
was an excellent mechanic, and boasted that he could earn his living at
almost any trade save the making of hangings. His father had established
the tapestry works at Mortlake; he himself had bought the Raffaelle
Cartoons to encourage the work&mdash;and much was to be hoped from a
monarch who had the taste and judgment to induce a Vandyke to settle in
England. The Civil war, whatever it has achieved for our liberty as subjects,
certainly hindered by many years our progress as an artistic people.</p>

</div>

<p>But to consider some of the furniture of this period in detail. Until
the sixteenth century was well advanced the word "table" in our
language meant an index or pocket book (tablets), or a list, not an article
of furniture. The table was, as we have noticed in the time of Elizabeth,
composed of boards generally hinged in the middle for convenience of
storage, and supported on trestles which were sometimes ornamented
by carved work. The word trestle, by the way, is said to be derived
from the "threstule," <em>i.e.</em>, three-footed supports, and these three-legged
stools and benches formed in those days the seats for everyone except
the master of the house. Chairs were, as we have seen, scarce articles;
sometimes there was only one, a throne-like seat for an honoured guest
or for the master or mistress of the house, and doubtless our present
phrase of "taking the chair" is a survival of the high place a chair
then held amongst the household gods of a gentleman's mansion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Shakespeare possibly had the boards and trestles in his mind when,
about 1596, he wrote in "Romeo and Juliet"&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i6">"Come, musicians, play!</div>
  <div class="i0">A hall! a hall! give room and foot it, girls</div>
  <div class="i0">More light, ye knaves, and turn the tables up"</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And as the scene in "King Henry the Fourth" is placed some years
earlier than that of "Romeo and Juliet," it is probable that "table" had
then its earlier meaning, for the Archbishop of York is made to say:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">". . . . The King is weary</div>
  <div class="i0">Of dainty and such picking grievances;</div>
  <div class="i0">And, therefore, will he wipe his tables clean,</div>
  <div class="i0">And keep no tell-tale to his memory."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Maskell, in his handbook on "Ivories," tells us that the word
"table" was also used, in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, to denote
the religious carvings and paintings in churches; and he quotes Chaucer
to show that the word was also used to describe the game of draughts.</p>

<p>Now, however, at the time of which we are writing, chairs
were becoming more plentiful and the table was a definite article
of furniture. In inventories of the time and for some twenty years
previous, as has been already noticed in the preceding chapter, we find
mention of "joyned table," framed table, "standing" and "dormant"
table, and the word "board" had gradually disappeared. It remains to
us, however, as a souvenir of the past, in the name we still give to a body
of men meeting for the transaction of business, and, in connection with
social life, in the phrase "the festive board." The width of these earlier
tables had been about 30 inches, and guests sat on one side only, with
their backs to the wall, in order, it may be supposed, to be the more
ready to resist any sudden raid which might be made on the house during
the relaxation of the supper hour, and this custom remained in use long
after there was any necessity for its observance.</p>

<p>In the time of Charles the First the width was increased, and a
contrivance was introduced for doubling the area of the top when required,
by drawing out two flaps from either end, and by means of a wedge-shaped
arrangement, the centre or main table top was lowered, and the
whole table, thus increased, became level. Illustrations taken from Mr.
G. T. Robinson's article on furniture in the "Art Journal" of 1881,
represent a "Drawinge table," which was the name by which these
"latest improvements" were known. The black lines were of stained
pear tree, let into the oak: the acorn shaped member of the leg
is an imported Dutch design, which became very common about this
time, and was applied to the supports of cabinets, sometimes as in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
illustration, plainly turned, but frequently carved. Another table of this
period was the "folding table," which was made with twelve, sixteen, or
with twenty legs, is shewn in the illustration of this example, and which,
as its name implies, would shut up into about one third of its extended
size. There is one of these tables in the Stationers' Hall.</p>

<p>It was probably in the early part of the seventeenth century that
the Couch became known in England. It was not common, nor quite
in the form in which we now recognize that luxurious article of furniture,
but was probably a carved oak settle, with cushions so arranged as to
form a resting lounge by day. Shakespeare speaks of the "branch'd
velvet gown" of Malvolio having come from a "day bed," and there is
also an allusion to one in Richard III.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>In a volume of "Notes and Queries" there is a note which would
shew that the lady's wardrobe of this time (1622) was a very primitive
article of furniture. Mention is made there of a list of articles of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
wearing apparel belonging to a certain Lady Elizabeth Morgan, sister to
Sir Nathaniel Rich, which, according to the old document there quoted,
dated the 13th day of November, 1622, "are to be found in a great bar'd
chest in my Ladie's Bedchamber." To judge from this list, Lady
Morgan was a person of fashion in those days. We may also take it
for granted that beyond the bedstead, a prie-dieu chair, a bench, some
chests, and the indispensable mirror, there was not much else with which
to furnish a lady's bedroom in the reign of James I. or that of his
successor.</p>

<p>The "long settle" and "scrowled chair" were two other kinds of
seats in use from the time of Charles I. to that of James II. The
illustrations are taken from authenticated specimens in the collection
of Mr. Dalton, of Scarborough. They are most probably of Yorkshire
manufacture, about the middle of the seventeenth century. The
ornament in the panel of the back of the chair is inlaid with box or
ash, stained to a greenish black to represent green ebony, and with
a few small pieces of rich red wood then in great favour. Mr. G. T.
Robinson, to whose article mentioned above we are indebted for the
description, says that this wood was "probably brought by some buccaneer
from the West." He also mentions another chair of the Stuart period,
which formed a table, and subsequently became the property of Theodore
Hook, who carefully preserved its pedigree. It was purchased by its late
owner, Mr. Godwin, editor of "The Builder." A woodcut of this chair
is on page <a href="#Page_107">107</a>.</p>

<p>Another chair to which there is an historical interest attached is that
in which Charles I. sat during his trial; this was exhibited in the
Stuart Exhibition in London in 1889. The illustration on page <a href="#Page_108">108</a> is
taken from a print in "The Illustrated London News" of the time.</p>

<p>In addition to the chairs of oak, carved, inlaid, and plain, which
were in some cases rendered more comfortable by having cushions tied
to the backs and seats, the upholstered chair, which we have seen had
been brought from Venice in the early part of the reign of James I.,
now came into general use. Few have survived, but there are still to
be seen in pictures of the period, chairs represented as covered with
crimson velvet, studded with brass nails, the seat being trimmed with
fringe, similar to that at Knole, illustrated on page <a href="#Page_100">100</a>.</p>

<p>There is in the Historical Portrait Gallery in Bethnal Green Museum,
a painting by an unknown artist, but dated 1642, of Sir William Lenthall,
who was Speaker of the House of Commons on the memorable occasion
when, on the 4th of January in that year, Charles I. entered the House
to demand the surrender of the five members. The chair on which Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
William is seated answers this description, and is very similar to the
one used by Charles I. (illustrated on page <a href="#Page_108">108</a>).</p>

<p>The importation of scarce foreign woods gave an impetus to inlaid
work in England, which had been crude and rough in the time of
Elizabeth. In the marqueterie of Italy, France, Holland, Germany, and
Spain, considerable excellence had already been attained. Mahogany had
been discovered by Raleigh as early as 1595, but did not come into
general use until the middle of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>During the year 1891, owing to the extension of the Great Eastern
Railway premises at Bishopsgate Street, an old house of antiquarian
interest was pulled down, and generously presented by the Company to
the South Kensington Museum. This has been erected so as to enable
the visitor to see a good example of the exterior as well as some of the
interior woodwork of a quaint house of the middle of the seventeenth
century. It was the residence of Sir Paul Pindar, during the time of
Charles I., and it contained a carved oak chimneypiece, with some other
good ornamental woodwork of this period.</p>

<p>In the illustration of a child's chair, which is said to have been
used by some of Cromwell's family, can be seen an example of carved
oak of this time; it was lent to the writer by its present owner, in
whose family it is an heirloom, one of his ancestors having married the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Protector's daughter. The ornament has no particular style, and it may
be taken for granted that the period of the Commonwealth was not
marked by any progress in decorative Art. The illustration of a staircase
on p. <a href="#Page_110">110</a> proves that there were exceptions to the prevalent Puritan
objection to figure ornament. In one of Mrs. S. C. Hall's papers,
"Pilgrimages to English Shrines," contributed in 1849 to "The Art
Journal," she describes the interior of the house which was built for
Bridget, the Protector's daughter, who married General Ireton. The
handsome oak staircase had the newels surmounted by carved figures,
representing different grades of men in the General's army&mdash;a captain,
common soldier, piper, drummer, etc., etc., while the spaces between the
balustrades were filled in with devices emblematical of warfare, the ceiling
being decorated in the fashion of the period. At the time Mrs. Hall
wrote, the house bore Cromwell's name and the date 1630.</p>

</div>

<p>We may date from the Commonwealth the more general use of chairs;
people sat as they chose, and no longer regarded the chair as the lord's
place. A style of chair we still recognise as Cromwellian was imported
from Holland about this time&mdash;plain square backs and seats covered with
brown leather, studded with brass nails. The legs, which are now generally
turned with a spiral twist, were in Cromwell's time plain and simple.</p>

<p>The residence of Charles II. abroad had accustomed him and his
friends to the much more luxurious furniture of France and Holland. With
the Restoration came a foreign Queen, a foreign Court, French manners,
and French literature. Cabinets, chairs, tables, and couches were
imported into England from the Netherlands, France, Spain, and Portugal;
and our craftsmen profited by new ideas and new patterns, and what was
of equal consequence, an increased demand for decorative articles of
furniture. The King of Portugal had ceded Bombay, one of the Portuguese
Indian Stations, to the new Queen of England, and there is a chair of this
Indo-Portuguese work, carved in ebony, now in the Museum at Oxford,
which was given by Charles II. either to Elias Ashmole or to Evelyn. The
chair is very similar to one at Penshurst; it is grouped with a settee of
like design, together with a small folding chair which Mr. G. T. Robinson,
in his article on "Seats," has described as Italian, but which we take
the liberty of pronouncing to be Flemish, judging by a similar one now
in the South Kensington Museum.</p>

<p>In connection with this Indo-Portuguese furniture, it would seem
that spiral turning became known and fashionable in England during the
reign of Charles II., and in some chairs of English make, which have
come under the writer's notice, the legs have been carved to imitate
the effects of spiral turning&mdash;an amount of superfluous labour which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
would scarcely have been incurred, but for the fact that the country
house-carpenter of this time had an imported model, which he copied,
without knowing how to produce by means of the lathe the effect which
had just come into fashion. There are, too, in certain illustrations in
"Shaw's Ancient Furniture," some lamp-holders, in which this spiral
turning is overdone, a fault which is frequently to be met with when any
particular kind of ornament comes into vogue.</p>

<p>The suite of furniture at Penshurst Place (illustrated), which comprises
thirteen pieces, was probably imported about this time; two of the
smaller chairs appear to have their original cushions, the others have been
re-covered by the late Lord de l'Isle and Dudley. The spindles of the
backs of two of the chairs are of ivory; the carving, which is in solid
ebony, is much finer on some than on others.</p>

<p>We gather a good deal of information about the furniture of this
period from the famous diary of Evelyn. He thus describes Hampton
Court Palace, as it appeared to him at the time of its preparation for
the reception of Catherine of Braganza, the bride of Charles II., who
spent the royal honeymoon in this historic building, which had in its
time sheltered for their brief spans of favour the six wives of Henry VIII.,
and the sickly boyhood of Edward VI.:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is as noble and uniform a pile as Gothic architecture can
make it. There is incomparable furniture in it, especially hangings
designed by Raphael, very rich with gold. Of the tapestries I believe
the world can show nothing nobler of the kind than the stories of
Abraham and Tobit.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>... The Queen's bed was an embroidery
of silver on crimson velvet, and cost £8,000, being a present made by
the States of Holland when his Majesty returned. The great looking-glass
and toilet of beaten massive gold were given by the Queen
Mother. The Queen brought over with her from Portugal such Indian
cabinets as had never before been seen here." Evelyn wrote, of course,
before Wren made his Renaissance additions to the Palace.</p>

<p>After the Great Fire, which occurred in 1666, and destroyed some
13,000 houses, and no less than 89 churches, Sir Christopher Wren was
given an opportunity, unprecedented in history, of displaying his power
of design and reconstruction. Writing of this great architect, Macaulay
says, "The austere beauty of the Athenian portico, the gloomy
sublimity of the Gothic arcade, he was, like most of his contemporaries,
incapable of emulating, and perhaps incapable of appreciating; but no
man born on our side of the Alps has imitated with so much success
the magnificence of the palace churches of Italy. Even the superb
Louis XIV. has left to posterity no work which can bear a comparison
with St. Paul's."</p>

<p>Wren's great masterpiece was commenced in 1675, and completed in
1710, and its building therefore covers a period of 35 years, carrying us
through the reigns of James II., William III. and Mary, and well on to the
end of Anne's reign. The admirable work which he did during this time,
and which has effected so much for the adornment of our Metropolis, had
a marked influence on the ornamental woodwork of the second half of
the seventeenth century: in the additions which he made to Hampton
Court Palace, in Bow Church, in the Hospitals of Greenwich and of
Chelsea, there is a sumptuousness of ornament in stone and marble,
which shew the influence exercised on his mind by the desire to rival the
grandeur of Louis XIV., the Fountain Court at Hampton being in direct
imitation of the Palace of Versailles. The carved woodwork of the choir
of St. Paul's, with fluted columns supporting a carved frieze; the richly
carved panels, and the beautiful figure work on both organ lofts, afford
evidence that the oak enrichments followed the marble and stone ornament.
The swags of fruit and flowers, the cherubs' heads with folded wings, and
other details in Wren's work, closely resemble the designs executed by
Gibbons, whose carving will be noticed later on.</p>

<p>It may be mentioned here that amongst the few churches in the city
which escaped the Great Fire, and contained woodwork of particular note,
are St. Helen's, Bishopsgate, and the Charterhouse Chapel, which
contain the original pulpits of about the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>The famous Dr. Busby, who for 55 years was head master of
Westminster School, was a great favourite of King Charles, and a
picture, painted by Sir Peter Lely, is said to have been presented to
the Doctor by His Majesty; it is called "Sedes Busbiana." Prints
from this old picture are scarce, and the writer is indebted to Mr. John
C. Thynne for the loan of his copy, from which the illustration is
taken. The portrait in the centre, of the Pedagogue aspiring to the
mitre, is that of Dr. South, who succeeded Busby, and whose monument
in Westminster Abbey is next to his. The illustration is interesting, as
although it may not have been actually taken from a chair itself, it
shews a design in the mind of a contemporary artist.</p>

<p>Of the Halls of the City Guilds, there is none more quaint, and in
greater contrast to the bustle of the neighbourhood, than the Hall of the
Brewers' Company, in Addle Street, City. This was partially destroyed,
like most of the older Halls, by the Great Fire, but was one of the
first to be restored and refurnished. In the kitchen are still to be seen
the remains of an old trestle, and other relics of an earlier period, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the hall or dining room, and the Court Room, are complete, with very
slight additions, since the date of their interior equipment in 1670 to
1673. The Court Room has a richly carved chimney piece in oak, nearly
black with age, the design of which is a shield with a winged head,
palms, and swags of fruit and flowers, while on the shield itself is an
inscription, stating that this room was wainscoted by Alderman Knight,
Master of the Company, and Lord Mayor of the City of London, in the
year 1670. The room itself is exceedingly quaint with its high wainscoting
and windows, reminding one of the portholes of a ship's cabin,
while the chief window looks out on to the old-fashioned garden, giving
the beholder altogether a pleasing illusion, carrying him back to the days
of Charles II.</p>

<p>The chief room or Hall is still more handsomely decorated with
carved oak of this time. The actual date, 1673, is over the doorway
on a tablet which bears the names, in the letters of the period, of the
master, "James Reading, Esq.," and the wardens, "Mr. Robert Lawrence,"
"Mr. Samuel Barber," and "Mr. Henry Sell."</p>

<p>The names of other masters and wardens are also written over the
carved escutcheons of their respective arms, and the whole room is one
of the best specimens in existence of the oak carving of this date. At
the western end is the Master's chair, of which by the courtesy of Mr.
Higgins, Clerk to the Company, we are able to give an illustration on
page <a href="#Page_115">115</a>; the shield-shaped back, the carved drapery, and the coat-of-arms
with the company's motto, are all characteristic features, as are also the
Corinthian columns and arched pediments in the oak decorations of the
room. The broken swan-necked pediment, which surmounts the cornice
of the room over the chair, is probably a more recent addition, this
ornament having come in about thirty years later.</p>

<p>There are also the old dining tables and benches: these are as
plain and simple as possible. In the Court Room is a table, which was
formerly in the Company's barge; it has some good inlaid work in the
arcading which connects the two end standards, and some old carved
lions' feet; the top and other parts have been renewed. There is also
an old oak fire-screen of about the end of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>Another city hall, the interior woodwork of which dates from just after
the Great Fire, is that of the Stationers' Company, in Ave Maria Lane,
close to Ludgate Hill. Mr. Charles Robert Rivington, the present Clerk
to the Company, has written a pamphlet, full of very interesting records
of this ancient and worshipful corporation, from which the following
paragraph is a quotation:&mdash;"The first meeting of the court after the fire,
was held at Cook's Hall, and the subsequent courts, until the hall was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
re-built, at the Lame Hospital Hall, <em>i.e.</em>, St. Bartholomew's Hospital.
In 1670 a committee was appointed to re-build the hall; and in 1674 the
Court agreed with Stephen Colledge (the famous Protestant joiner, who
was afterwards hanged at Oxford in 1681) to wainscot the hall 'with
well-seasoned and well-matched wainscot, according to a model delivered
in for the sum of £300.' His work is now to be seen in excellent
condition."</p>

<p>Mr. Rivington read his paper to the London and Middlesex
Archæological Society in 1881; and the writer can with pleasure confirm
his statement as to the condition, in 1899, of this fine specimen of
seventeenth century work. Less ornate and elaborate than the Brewers'
Hall, the panels are only slightly relieved with carved mouldings; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
end of the room, or main entrance, opposite the place of the old daïs
(long since removed), is somewhat similar to that in the Brewers' Hall,
and presents a fine architectural effect, which will be observed in the
illustration on page <a href="#Page_117">117</a>.</p>

<p>There is above an illustration of one of the two livery cupboards,
which formerly stood on the daïs, and these are good examples of the
cupboards for display of plate of this period. The lower part was formerly
the receptacle for unused viands, which were distributed to the poor after
the feast. In their original state these livery cupboards finished with a
straight cornice, the broken pediments with the eagle (the Company's
crest) having most probably been added when the Hall was, to quote an
inscription on a shield, "repaired and beautified in the mayoralty of the
Right Honourable William Gill, in the year 1788," when Mr. Thomas
Hooke was Master, and Mr. Field and Mr. Rivington (the present Clerk's
grandfather) Wardens.</p>

<p>There is still preserved in a lumber room one of the old benches of
seventeenth century work&mdash;now replaced in the hall by modern folding
chairs. This is of oak, with turned skittle-shaped legs slanting outwards,
and connected and strengthened by plain stretchers. The old tables are
still in their original places.</p>

</div>

<p>Another example of seventeenth century oak panelling is the
handsome chapel of the Mercers' Hall&mdash;the only city Company possessing
their own chapel&mdash;but only the lining of the walls and the reredos are of
the original work, the remainder having been added some ten or twelve
years ago, when some of the original carving was made use of in the
new work. Indeed, in this magnificent hall, about the most spacious of
the old City Corporation Palaces, there is a great deal of new work
mixed with old&mdash;new chimney pieces and old overmantels&mdash;some of
Grinling Gibbons' carved enrichments, so painted and varnished as to
have lost much of their character; these have been applied to the oak
panels in the large dining hall.</p>

<p>The woodwork lining of living rooms had been undergoing changes
since the commencement of the period of which we are now writing. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
1638 a man named Christopher had taken out a patent for enamelling
and gilding leather, which was used as a wall decoration over the oak
panelling. This decorated leather had hitherto been imported from
Holland and Spain; when this was not used, and tapestry, which was
very expensive, was not obtainable, the plaster was roughly ornamented.
Somewhat later than this, pictures were let into the wainscot to form part
of the decoration, for in 1669 Evelyn, when writing of the house of the
"Earl of Norwich," in Epping Forest, says, "A good many pictures put
into the wainscot which Mr. Baker, his lordship's predecessor, brought
from Spaine." Indeed, subsequently the wainscot became simply the
frame for pictures, and the same writer deplores the disuse of timber,
and expresses his opinion that a sumptuary law ought to be passed to
restore the "ancient use of timber." Although no law was enacted on
the subject, yet, some twenty years later, the whirligig of fashion brought
about the revival of the custom of lining rooms with oak panelling.</p>

<p>It is said that about 1670 Evelyn found Grinling Gibbons in a small
thatched house on the outskirts of Deptford, and introduced him to the
King, who gave him an appointment on the Board of Works, and
patronised him with extensive orders. The character of his carving is
well known; generally using lime-tree as the vehicle of his designs,
his life-like birds and flowers, groups of fruit, and heads of cherubs, are
easily recognised. One of the rooms in Windsor Castle is decorated
with the work of his chisel, which can also be seen in St. Paul's
Cathedral, Hampton Court Palace, Chatsworth, Burleigh, and perhaps
his best, in Petworth House, in Sussex. He also sculptured in stone. The
base of King Charles' statue at Windsor, the font of St. James', Piccadilly
(round the base of which are figures of Adam and Eve), are his
work, as is also the lime-tree border of festoon work over the Communion
table. Gibbons was an Englishman, but appears to have spent his boyhood
in Holland, where he was christened "Grinling." He died in 1721.
His pupils were Samuel Watson, a Derbyshire man, who did much of
the carved work at Chatsworth, Drevot of Brussels, and Lawreans of
Mechlin. Gibbons and his pupils founded a school of carving in England
which has been continued by tradition to the present day.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>SILVER FURNITURE AT KNOLE.</p>

<p>(<em>From a Photo by Mr. Corke, of Sevenoaks.</em>)</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>A somewhat important immigration of French workmen occurred
about this time, owing to the persecutions of Protestants in France, which
followed the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, by Louis XIV.,
and these refugees bringing with them their skill, their patterns and ideas,
influenced the carving of our ornamental frames, and the designs of some
of our furniture. This influence is to be traced in some of the contents
of Hampton Court Palace, particularly in the carved and gilt centre tables
and the <em>torchères</em> of French design but of English workmanship. It is said
that no less than 50,000 families left France, some thousands of whom
belonged to the industrial classes, and settled in England and Germany,
where their descendants still remain. They introduced the manufacture
of crystal chandeliers, and founded our Spitalfields silk industry, and other
trades till then little practised in England.</p>

<p>The beautiful silver furniture at Knole belongs to this time, having
been made for one of the Earls of Dorset, in the reign of James II.
The illustration is from a photograph taken by Mr. Corke, of Sevenoaks.
Electrotypes of the originals are in the South Kensington Museum.
From two other suites at Knole, consisting of a looking glass, a table,
and a pair of <em>torchères</em>, in the one case of plain walnut wood, and
in the other of ebony with silver mountings, it would appear that a
toilet suite of furniture of the time of James II. generally consisted of
articles more or less costly, according to circumstances, but of a similar
pattern to those shewn in the illustration. The silver table bears the
English Hall mark of the reign.</p>

<p>Specimens of English furniture, dating from about 1680 to 1700,
distinctly shew the influence of Flemish design. The Stadtholder, King
William III., with his Dutch friends, imported many of their household
gods, and our English craftsmen seem to have copied these very closely.
The chairs and settees in the South Kensington Museum, and at Hampton
Court Palace, have the shaped back, with a wide inlaid or carved upright
bar; the cabriole leg and the carved shell ornament on the knee of the
leg, and on the top of the back, which are still to be seen in many of
the old Dutch houses.</p>

<p>There are a few examples of furniture of this date, which it is almost
impossible to distinguish from Flemish, but in some others there is a
characteristic decoration in marqueterie, which may be described as a
seaweed scroll in holly or box wood, inlaid on a pale walnut ground. A
good example of this is to be seen in the upright "grandfather's clock"
in the South Kensington Museum, the effect being a pleasing harmony of
color.</p>

<p>In the same collection there is also a walnut wood centre table, dating
from about 1700, which has twisted legs and a stretcher, the top being
inlaid with intersecting circles, relieved by the inlay of some stars in ivory.</p>

<p>As we have observed with regard to French furniture of this time,
mirrors came more generally into use, and the frames were both carved
and inlaid. There are several of these at Hampton Court Palace, all with
bevelled edged plate glass; some have frames entirely of glass, the short
lengths which make the frame having, in some cases, the joints covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
by rosettes of blue glass, and in others a narrow moulding of gilt work
on each side of the frame. In one room (the Queen's Gallery) the frames
are painted in colors and relieved by a little gilding.</p>

<p>The taste for importing old Dutch furniture, also lacquer cabinets
from Japan, not only gave relief to the appearance of a well furnished
apartment of this time, but also brought new ideas to our designers and
workmen. Our collectors, too, were at this time appreciating the Oriental
china, both blue and white, and colored, which had a good market in
Holland, so that with the excellent silversmith's work then obtainable, it
was possible in the time of William and Mary to arrange a room with
more artistic effect than at an earlier period, when the tapestry and
panelling of the the walls, a table, the livery cupboard previously described,
and some three or four chairs, had formed almost the whole furniture of
reception rooms.</p>

<p>The first mention of corner cupboards appears to have been made
in an advertisement of a Dutch joiner in "The Postman" of March 8th,
1711; these cupboards, with their carved pediments, being part of the
modern fittings of a room of the time of Queen Anne.</p>

<p>The oak presses common to this and earlier times are formed of
an upper and lower part, the former sometimes being three sides of an
octagon with the top supported by columns, while the lower half is
straight, and the whole is carved with incised ornament. These useful
articles of furniture, in the absence of wardrobes, are described in
inventories of the time (1680-1720) as "press cupboards," "great cupboards,"
"wainscot," and "joyned cupboards."</p>

<p>The first mention of a "Buerow," as our modern word "Bureau"
was then spelt, is said by Dr. Lyon, in his American book, "The Colonial
Furniture of New England," to have occurred in an advertisement in
"The Daily Post" of January 4th, 1727. The same author quotes
Bailey's Dictionarium Britannicum, published in London, 1736, as defining
the word "bureau" as "a cabinet or chest of drawers, or 'scrutoir'
for depositing papers or accounts."</p>

<p>In the latter half of the eighteenth century these convenient pieces of
furniture came into more general use, and illustrations of them as
designed and made by Chippendale and his contemporaries will be found
in the chapter dealing with that period.</p>

<p>Dr. Lyon also quotes from an American newspaper, "The Boston
News Letter" of April 16th, 1716, an advertisement which was evidently
published when the tall clocks, which we now call "grandfathers' clocks,"
were a novelty, and as such were being introduced to the American
public. We have already referred to one of those which is in the South<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Kensington Museum (date 1700), and no doubt the manufacture of
similar clocks became more general during the first years of the eighteenth
century. The advertisement alluded to runs, "Lately come from London,
a parcel of very fine clocks&mdash;they go a week and repeat the hour when
pulled" (a string caused the same action as the pressing of the handle
of a repeating watch) "in Japan cases or <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'wallnut'">walnut</ins>."</p>

<p>The style of decoration in furniture and woodwork which we recognise
as "Queen Anne," apart from the marqueterie just described, appears,
so far as the writer's investigations have gone, to be due to the designs
of some eminent architects of the time. Sir James Vanbrugh was
building Blenheim Place for the Queen's victorious general, and also
Castle Howard. Nicholas Hawksmoor had erected St. George's, Bloomsbury,
and James Gibbs, a Scotch architect and antiquary, St. Martin's-in-the-Fields,
and the Royal Library at Oxford: a ponderous style
characterises the woodwork interior of these buildings. We give an
illustration of three designs for chimney pieces and overmantels by James
Gibbs, the centre one of which illustrates the curved or "swan-necked"
pediment, which became a favourite ornament about this time, until
supplanted by the heavier triangular pediment which came in with "the
Georges."</p>

<p>The contents of Hampton Court Palace afford evidence of the
transition which took place in the design of woodwork and furniture
from the time of William III. until that of George II. There is the
Dutch chair with cabriole leg, the plain walnut card table also of Dutch
design, which probably came over with the Stadtholder; then, there are
the heavy draperies, and chairs almost completely covered by Spitalfields
silk velvet, to be seen in the bedroom furniture of Queen Anne. Later
on, as the heavy Georgian style predominated, there is the stiff ungainly
gilt furniture, console tables with legs ornamented with the Greek key
pattern badly applied, and finally, as the French school of design
influenced our carvers, an improvement may be noticed in the tables
and <em>torchères</em>, which, but for being a trifle clumsy, might pass for the
work of French craftsmen of the same time. The state chairs, the
bedstead, and some stools, which are said to have belonged to Queen
Caroline, are further examples of the adoption of French fashion.</p>

<p>Nearly all writers on the subject of furniture and woodwork are
agreed in considering that the earlier part of the period discussed in
this chapter&mdash;namely, the seventeenth century, gives us the best examples
of English work. As we have seen in noticing some of the earlier
Jacobean examples already illustrated and described, it was a period
marked by increased refinement of design, through the abandonment of
the more grotesque and often coarse work of Elizabethan carving, and by
soundness of construction and thorough workmanship.</p>

<p>Oak furniture made in England during the seventeenth century, is
still a credit to the painstaking craftsmen of those days, and even
upholstered furniture, like the couches and chairs at Knole, after more
than 250 years' service, are fit for use. When we come to deal with
furniture of the present day, and the methods of production which are
now in practice, a comparison will be made which must be to the credit
of the Jacobean period.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the foregoing chapters an attempt has been made to preserve,
as far as possible, a certain continuity in the history of the subject
matter of this work from the earliest times until after the Renaissance
had been generally adopted in Europe. In this endeavour a greater
amount of attention has been bestowed upon the furniture of a comparatively
short period of English history, than upon that of other countries,
but it is hoped that this fault will be forgiven by English readers.</p>

<p>It has now become necessary to interrupt this plan, and before
returning to the consideration of European design and work, to devote
a short chapter to those branches of the Industrial Arts connected with
furniture, which flourished in China and Japan, in India, Persia, and
Arabia, at a time anterior and subsequent to the Renaissance period in
Europe.</p>

<h5>CHINESE AND JAPANESE FURNITURE.</h5>

<p><span class="figleft100"><img src="images/i_125.jpg" width="184" height="300" alt="W" /></span>E have been unable to discover when the
Chinese first began to use state or domestic
furniture. Whether, like the ancient Assyrians
and Egyptians, there was an early civilization
which included the arts of joining, carving,
and upholstering, we do not know; most
probably there was; and from the plaster
casts which one sees in our Indian Museum,
of the ornamental stone gateways of Sanchi
Tope, in Bhopal, Central India, it would
appear that, in the early part of our
Christian era, the carvings in wood of their
neighbours and co-religionists, the Hindoos,
represented figures of men and animals in
the woodwork of sacred buildings or palaces.
The marvellous dexterity in manipulating
wood, ivory and stone which we recognize in
the Chinese of to-day, is probably inherited from their early ancestors.</p>

<p>Sir William Chambers travelled in China in the early part of the
eighteenth century. It was he who introduced "the Chinese style" into
furniture and decoration, which was adopted by Chippendale and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
makers, as will be noticed in the chapter dealing with that period of
English furniture. He gives us the following description of the furniture
he found in "The Flowery Land."</p>

<p>"The movables of the saloon consist of chairs, stools, and tables;
made sometimes of rosewood, ebony, or lacquered work, and sometimes
of bamboo only, which is cheap, and, nevertheless, very neat. When
the movables are of wood, the seats of the stools are often of marble
or porcelain, which, though hard to sit on, are far from unpleasant in
a climate where the summer heats are so excessive. In the corners
of the rooms are stands four or five feet high, on which they set
plates of citrons, and other fragrant fruits, or branches of coral in
vases of porcelain, and glass globes containing goldfish, together with
a certain weed somewhat resembling fennel; on such tables as are
intended for ornament only they also place the little landscapes, composed
of rocks, shrubs, and a kind of lily that grows among pebbles covered
with water. Sometimes, also, they have artificial landscapes made of
ivory, crystal, amber, pearls, and various stones. I have seen some of
these that cost over 300 guineas, but they are at least mere baubles,
and miserable imitations of Nature. Besides these landscapes they adorn
their tables with several vases of porcelain, and little vases of copper,
which are held in great esteem. These are generally of simple and
pleasing forms. The Chinese say they were made two thousand years
ago, by some of their celebrated artists, and such as are real antiques
(for there are many counterfeits) they buy at an extravagant price,
giving sometimes no less than £300 sterling for one of them.</p>

<p>"The bedroom is divided from the saloon by a partition of folding
doors, which, when the weather is hot, are in the night thrown open
to admit the air. It is very small, and contains no other furniture
than the bed, and some varnished chests in which they keep their
apparel. The beds are very magnificent; the bedsteads are made much
like ours in Europe&mdash;of rosewood, carved, or lacquered work; the curtains
are of taffeta or gauze, sometimes flowered with gold, and commonly
either blue or purple. About the top a slip of white satin, a foot in
breadth, runs all round, on which are painted, in panels, different
figures&mdash;flower pieces, landscapes, and conversation pieces, interspersed
with moral sentences and fables written in Indian ink and vermilion."</p>

<p>From old paintings and engravings which date from about the fourteenth
or fifteenth century, one gathers an idea of such furniture as
existed in China and Japan in earlier times. In one of these, which is
reproduced in Racinet's "Le Costume Historique," there is a Chinese
princess reclining on a sofa which has a frame of black wood, visible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
and slightly ornamented; it is upholstered with rich embroidery, for
which these artistic people seem to have been famous from a very early
period. A servant stands by her side to hand her the pipe of opium
with which the monotony of the day was varied&mdash;one arm rests on a
small wooden table or stand which is placed on the sofa, and which holds
a flower vase and a pipe stand. On another old painting two figures
are seated on mats playing a game which resembles draughts, the pieces
being moved about on a little table with black and white squares like a
modern chessboard, with shaped feet to raise it a convenient height for
the players; on the floor, cups of tea stand ready at hand. Such pictures
are generally ascribed to the fifteenth century, the period of the great
Ming dynasty, which appears to have been the time of an improved
culture and taste in China.</p>

<p>From this time and a century later (the sixteenth) also date those
beautiful cabinets of lacquered wood enriched with ivory, mother-of-pearl,
with silver and even with gold, which have been brought to England
occasionally; but genuine specimens of this, and of the seventeenth
century, are very scarce and extremely valuable.</p>

<p>The older Chinese furniture which one sees generally in Europe
dates from the eighteenth century, and was made to order and imported
by the Dutch; this explains the curious combination to be found of
Oriental and European designs; thus there are screens with views of
Amsterdam and other cities copied from paintings sent out for the
purpose, while the frames of the panels are of carved rosewood of the
fretted bamboo pattern, characteristic of the Chinese. Elaborate bedsteads,
tables, and cabinets were also made, with panels of ash stained a dark
color, and ornamented with hunting scenes, in which the representations
of men and horses are of ivory, or sometimes with ivory faces and limbs,
and the clothes chiefly of a brown colored wood.</p>

<p>In a beautiful table in the South Kensington Museum, which is
said to have been made in Cochin-China, mother-of-pearl is largely used
and produces a rich effect.</p>

<p>The furniture brought back by the late Duke of Edinburgh from China
and Japan is of the usual character imported, and the remarks hereafter
made on Indian or Bombay furniture apply equally to this adaptation of
Chinese detail to European designs.</p>

<p>The most highly prized work of China and Japan in the way of
decorative furniture is the beautiful lacquer work, and in the notice on
French furniture of the eighteenth century, in a subsequent chapter, we
shall see that the process was adopted in Holland, France, and England
with more or less success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>It is worth while, however, to allude to it here a little more fully.</p>

<p>The process as practised in China is thus described by M. Jacquemart:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The wood when smoothly planed is covered with a sheet of thin
paper or silk gauze, over which is spread a thick coating made of
powdered red sandstone and buffalo's gall. This is allowed to dry, after
which it is polished and rubbed with wax, or else receives a wash of gum
water, holding chalk in solution. The varnish is laid on with a flat
brush, and the article is placed in a damp drying room, whence it passes
into the hands of a workman, who moistens and again polishes it with
a piece of very fine grained soft clay slate, or with the stalks of the
horse-tail or shave grass. It then receives a second coating of lacquer,
and when dry is once more polished. These operations are repeated
until the surface becomes perfectly smooth and lustrous. There are
never applied less than three coatings and seldom more than eighteen,
though some old Chinese and some Japan ware are said to have received
upwards of twenty. As regards China, this seems quite exceptional, for
there is in the Louvre a piece with the legend 'lou-tinsg,' <em>i.e.</em>, six
coatings, implying that even so many are unusual enough to be worthy
of special mention."</p>

<p>There is as much difference between different kinds and qualities of
lac as between different classes of marqueterie. The most highly prized
is the L<span class="smcapa">ACQUER</span> <span class="smcapa">ON</span> G<span class="smcapa">OLD</span> G<span class="smcapa">ROUND</span>, and the first specimens of this work
which reached Europe during the time of Louis XV. were presentation
pieces from the Japanese Princes to some of the Dutch officials. This
lacquer on gold ground is rarely found in furniture, and only as a rule
in some of those charming little boxes, in which the luminous effect of the
lac is heightened by the introduction of silver foliage on a minute scale,
or of tiny landscape work and figures charmingly treated, partly with
dull gold, and partly with gold highly burnished. Small placques of this
beautiful ware were used for some of the choicest pieces of furniture
made for Marie Antoinette, and mounted by Gouthière.</p>

<p>A<span class="smcapa">VANTURINE</span> lacquer closely imitates in color the sparkling mineral
from which it takes its name, and a less highly finished preparation of it
is used as a lining for the small drawers of cabinets. Another lacquer has
a black ground, on which landscapes delicately traced in gold stand out in
charming relief. Such pieces also were used by Riesener and mounted by
Gouthière in some of the most costly furniture made for Marie Antoinette;
specimens of such furniture are in the Louvre. It is this kind of lacquer,
in varying qualities, that is usually found in cabinets, folding screens,
coffers, tables, étagéres, and other ornamental articles. Enriched with inlay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
of mother-of-pearl, the effect of which is in some cases heightened and
rendered more effective by transparent coloring on its reverse side, as in
the case of a bird's plumage or of those beautiful blossoms which both
Chinese and Japanese artists can represent so faithfully.</p>

<p>A very remarkable screen in Chinese lacquer of later date is in the
South Kensington Museum; it is composed of twelve folds, each ten feet
high, and measuring when fully extended twenty-one feet. This screen is
very beautifully decorated on both sides with incised and raised ornaments
painted and gilt on black ground, with a rich border ornamented with
representations of sacred symbols and various other objects. The price
paid for it was £1,000. There are also in the Museum some very rich
chairs of modern Chinese work, in brown wood, probably teak, very
elaborately inlaid with mother-of-pearl; they were exhibited in Paris in
1867.</p>

<p>Of the very early history of Japanese industrial arts we know but
little. We have no record of the kind of furniture which Marco Polo
found when he travelled in Japan in the thirteenth century; and until the
Jesuit missionaries obtained a footing in the sixteenth century, and sent
home specimens of native work, there was probably very little of
Japanese manufacture which found its way to Europe. The beautiful
lacquer work of Japan, which dates from the end of the sixteenth and
the following century, leads us to suppose that a long period of probation
must have occurred before these processes, which were probably learned
from the Chinese, could have been so thoroughly mastered.</p>

<p>Of furniture&mdash;with the exception of the cabinets, chests, and boxes,
large and small&mdash;of this famous lac, there appears to have been little.
Until the Japanese developed a taste for copying European customs and
manners, the habit seems to have been to sit on mats and to use small
tables raised a few inches from the ground. Even the bedrooms contained
no bedsteads, but a light mattress served for bed and bedstead.</p>

<p>The process of lacquering has already been described, and in the
chapter on French furniture of the eighteenth century it will be seen
how specimens of this decorative material reached France by way of
Holland, and were mounted into the "<em>meubles de luxe</em>" of that time.
With this exception, and that of the famous collection of porcelain in the
Japan Palace at Dresden, probably but little of the Art products of this
artistic people had been exported until the country was opened up by the
expedition of Lord Elgin and Commodore Perry, in 1858-9, and subsequently
by the antiquarian knowledge and research of Sir Rutherford
Alcock, who has contributed so much to our knowledge of Japanese
Industrial Art; indeed, it is scarcely too much to say, that so far as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
England is concerned, he was the first to introduce the products of the
Empire of Japan.</p>

<p>The Revolution, and the break up of the feudal system which had
existed in that country for some eight hundred years, ended by placing
the Mikado on the throne. There was a sale in Paris, in 1867, of
the famous collection of the Shôgun, who had sent his treasures there to
raise funds for the civil war in which he was then engaged with the
Daimio. This was followed by the exportation of other fine native
productions to Paris and London; but the supply of old and really fine
specimens has, since about 1874, almost ceased, and, in default, the
European markets have become flooded with articles of cheap and inferior
workmanship, imported to meet the modern demand. The present Government
of Japan, anxious to recover many of the masterpieces which were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
produced in the best time, under the patronage of the native princes of
the old <em>régime</em>, have established a museum at Tokio, where many examples
of fine lacquer work, which had been sent to Europe for sale, have been
placed after repurchase, to serve as examples for native artists to copy,
and to assist in the restoration of the ancient reputation of Japan.</p>

<p>There is in the South Kensington Museum a very beautiful Japanese
chest of lacquer work made about the beginning of the seventeenth
century, the best time for Japanese Art; it formerly belonged to Napoleon I.,
and was purchased at the Hamilton Palace Sale for £722: it is some
3ft. 3in. long and 2ft. 1in. high, and was intended originally as a
receptacle for sacred Buddhist books. There are, most delicately worked
on to its surface, views of the interior of one of the Imperial Palaces
of Japan, and a hunting scene. Mother-of-pearl, gold, silver, and
avanturine, are all used in the enrichment of this beautiful specimen of
inlaid work, and the lock plate is a representative example of the best
kind of metal work as applied to this purpose.</p>

<p>The late Duke of Saxe-Coburg had several fine specimens of Chinese
and Japanese lacquer work in his collection, about the arrangement of
which the writer had the honour of advising His Royal Highness, when it
arrived some years ago at Clarence House. The earliest specimen is a
reading desk, presented to him by the Mikado, with a slope for a book,
much resembling an ordinary bookrest, but charmingly decorated with
lacquer in landscape subjects on the flat surfaces, while the smaller parts are
diapered with flowers and quatrefoils in relief of lac and gold. This is of
the sixteenth century. The collections of the Earl of Elgin and Kincardine,
Sir Rutherford Alcock, K.C.B., Mr. Salting, Viscount Gough, and other
well-known amateurs, contain some excellent examples of the best periods
of Japanese Art work of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.</p>

<p>The grotesque carving of the wonderful dragons and marvellous
monsters introduced into furniture made by the Chinese and Japanese,
and especially in the ornamental woodwork of the Old Temples, is
thoroughly peculiar to those masters of elaborate design and skilful manipulation:
and the low rate of remuneration, compared with our European
notions of wages, enables work to be produced that would be impracticable
under any other conditions. In comparing the ornamentation on Chinese
with that of Japanese furniture, it may be said that more eccentricity is
effected by the latter than by the former in their designs and general
decoration. The Japanese joiner is unsurpassed, and much of the lattice
work, admirable in design and workmanship, is so quaint and intricate
that only by close examination can it be distinguished from finely cut
fret work.</p>

<h5>INDIAN FURNITURE.</h5>

<p>European influence upon Indian Art and manufactures has been of
long duration. It was first exercised by the Portuguese and Dutch in the
early days of the United East India Company, afterwards by the French,
who established a trading company there in 1664, and lastly by the
English, the first charter of the old East India Company dating as far
back as 1600. Thus European taste dominated almost everything of an
ornamental character until it became difficult to find a decorative article
the design of which did not in some way or other shew the predominance
of European influence over native conception. Therefore it becomes
important to ascertain what kind of furniture, limited as it was, existed
in India during the period of the Mogul Empire, which lasted from 1505
to 1739, when the invasion of the Persians under Kouli Khan destroyed
the power of the Moguls. The country formerly subject to them was then
divided among sundry petty princes.</p>

<p>The throne and State chairs used by the Moguls were rich with
elaborate gilding; the legs or supports were sometimes of turned wood,
with some of the members carved; the chair was formed like an hour
glass, or rather like two bowls reversed, with the upper part extended to
form a higher back to the seat. In M. Racinet's sumptuous work, "Le
Costume Historique," published in Paris in 20 volumes (1876), there are
reproduced some old miniatures from the collection of M. Ambroise Didot.
These represent&mdash;with all the advantages of the most highly finished
printing in gold, silver, and colours&mdash;portraits of these native sovereigns
seated on their State chairs, with the umbrella, as a sign of royalty. The
panels and ornaments of the thrones are picked out with patterns of
flowers, sometimes detached blossoms, sometimes the whole plant; the
colors are generally bright red and green, while the ground of a panel
or the back of a chair is in silver, with arabesque tracery, the rest of the
chair being entirely gilt. The couches are rectangular, with four turned
and carved supports, some eight or ten inches high, and also gilt. With
the exception of small tables, which could be carried into the room by
slaves, and used for the light refreshments customary to the country, there
was no other furniture. The ladies of the harem are represented as being
seated on sumptuous carpets, and the walls are ornamented with gold
and silver and color, a style of decoration very well suited to the arched
openings, carved and gilt doors, and brilliant costumes of the occupants
of these Indian palaces.</p>

<p>After the break up of the Mogul power, the influence of Holland,
France, and England brought about a mixture of taste and design which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
with the concurrent alterations in manners and customs, gradually led to
the production of what is now known as the "Bombay Furniture." The
patient, minute carving of Indian design applied to utterly uncongenial
Portuguese or French shapes of chairs and sofas, or to the familiar round
or oval table, carved almost beyond recognition, are instances of this
style. One sees these occasionally in the house of an Anglo-Indian, who
has employed native workmen to make some of this furniture for him;
the European chairs and tables having been given as models, while the
details of the ornament have been left to native taste. There are in the
Indian Museum at South Kensington several examples of this Bombay
furniture, and also some of Cingalese manufacture.</p>

<p>It is scarcely part of our subject to allude to the same kind of
influence which has spoiled the quaint bizarre effect of native design and
workmanship in silver, in jewellery, in carpets, embroideries, and in
pottery, which was so manifest in the contributions sent to South
Kensington at the Colonial Exhibition, 1886.</p>

<p>In the Jones Collection at South Kensington Museum, there are two
carved ivory chairs and a table, the latter gilded, the former partly gilded,
which are a portion of a set taken from Tippo Sahib at the storming
of Seringapatam. Warren Hastings brought them to England, and they
were given to Queen Charlotte. After her death the set was divided:
Lord Londesborough purchased part of it, and this portion is now on
loan at the Bethnal Green Museum.</p>

<p>Queen Victoria had also amongst her numerous Jubilee presents some
very handsome ivory furniture of Indian workmanship, which may be seen
at Windsor Castle. These, however, as well as the Jones Collection
examples, though thoroughly Indian in character as regards the treatment
of scrolls, flowers, and foliage, shew unmistakably the influence of French
taste in their general form and composition. Articles, such as boxes, stands
for gongs, etc., are to be found carved in sandal wood, and in <em>dalburgia</em>,
or black wood, with rosewood mouldings; and a peculiar characteristic
of this Indian decoration, sometimes applied to such small articles of
furniture, is the coating of the surface of the wood with red lacquer,
the plain parts taking a high polish while the carved enrichment remains
dull. The effect of this is precisely that of the article being made of red
sealing wax, and frequently the minute pattern of the carved ornament
and its general treatment tend to give an idea of an impression made in
the wax by an elaborately cut die. The casket illustrated on page <a href="#Page_134">134</a>
is an example of this treatment. It was exhibited in 1851.</p>

<p>The larger examples of Indian carved woodwork are of teak; the
finest and most characteristic specimens within the writer's knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
are the two folding doors which were sent as a present to the Indian
Government, and are in the Indian Museum. They are of seventeenth
century work, and are said to have enclosed a library at Kerowlee. While
the door frames are of teak, with the outer frames carved with bands of
foliage in high relief, the doors themselves are divided into panels of
fantastic shapes, and yet so arranged that there is just sufficient regularity
to please the eve. Some of these panels are carved and enriched with
ivory flowers, others have a rosette of carved ivory in the centre, and pieces
of talc with green and red color underneath, a decoration also found in
some Arabian work. It is almost impossible to convey by words an
adequate description of these doors; they should be carefully examined
as examples of genuine native design and workmanship. Mr. Pollen
has concluded a somewhat detailed account of them by saying:&mdash;"For
elegance of shape and proportion, and the propriety of the composition
of the frame and sub-divisions of these doors, their mouldings and their
panel carvings and ornaments, we can for the present name no other
example so instructive. We are much reminded by this decoration of
the pierced lattices at the S. Marco in Venice."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>There is in the Indian Museum another remarkable specimen of
native furniture&mdash;namely, a chair of the purest beaten gold of octagonal
shape, and formed of two bowls reversed, decorated with acanthus and
lotus in repousée ornament. This is of eighteenth century workmanship,
and was formerly the property of Runjeet Sing. The precious metal is
thinly laid on, according to the Eastern method, the wood underneath
the gold taking all the weight. This throne was to have been used at
the opening of the Imperial Institute by Queen Victoria, but at the last
moment another seat was selected.</p>

<p>There is also a collection of plaster casts of portions of temples and
palaces from a very early period until the present time, several having
been sent over as a loan to the Indian and Colonial Exhibition of 1886.</p>

<p>A careful observation of the ornamental details of these casts leads us
to the conclusion that the Byzantine style, which was dominant throughout
the more civilized portion of Asia during the power of the Romans, had
survived the great changes of the Middle Ages. As native work became
subject more or less to the influence of the Indo-Chinese carvers of deities
on the one side, and of the European notions of the Portuguese pioneers
of discovery on the other, a fashion of decorative woodwork was arrived
at which can scarcely be dignified by the name of a style, and which it
is difficult to describe. Sir George Birdwood, in his work on Indian Art,
points out that, about a hundred years ago, Indian designs were affected
by the immigration of Persian designers and workmen. The result of
this influence is to be seen in the examples in the Museum, a short
notice of which will conclude these remarks on Indian work.</p>

<p>The copy in shishem wood of a carved window at Amritzar, in the
Punjaub, with its overhanging cornice, ornamental arches, supported by
pillars, and the surface, covered with small details of ornament, is a good
example of the sixteenth and seventeenth century work. The façades of
dwelling houses in teak wood, carved, and still bearing the remains of
paint with which part of the carving was picked out, represent the work
of the contemporary carvers of Ahmedabad, famous for its woodwork.</p>

<p>Portions of a lacquer work screen similar in appearance to embossed
gilt leather, with the pattern in gold, on a ground of black or red, and
the singular Cashmere work, called "mirror mosaic," give us a good idea
of the Indian decoration of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.
This effective decoration is produced by little pieces of looking glass being
introduced into the small geometrical patterns of the panels; these, when
joined together, form a very rich ceiling.</p>

<p>The bedstead of King Theebaw, brought from Mandalay, is an
example of this mixture of glass and wood, which can be made extremely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
effective. The wood is carved and gilt to represent the gold setting of
numerous precious stones, which are counterfeited by small pieces of
looking-glass and variously-colored pieces of transparent glass.</p>

<p>Some of King Edward's (at the time Prince of Wales) presents&mdash;namely,
chairs with carved lions forming arms; tables of shishem wood,
inlaid with ebony and ivory, shew the European influence we have alluded to.</p>

<p>Amongst the modern ornamental articles in the Museum are many
boxes, pen trays, writing cases, and even photographic albums, of wood
and ivory mosaic work, the inlaid patterns being produced by placing
together strips of tin wire, sandal wood, ebony, and of ivory, white, or
stained green: these strips, when bound into a rod, either triangular or
hexagonal, are cut into small sections, and then inlaid into the surface
of the article to be decorated.</p>

<p>Papier maché and lacquer work are also frequently found in small
articles of furniture; and the collection of drawings by native artists
attest the high skill in design and execution attained by Indian craftsmen.</p>


<h5>PERSIA.</h5>

<p>The Persians have from time immemorial been an artistic people,
and their style of Art throughout successive generations has varied but
little.</p>

<p>Major-General Murdoch Smith, R.E., the present Director of the
branch of the South Kensington Museum in Edinburgh, who resided for
some years in Persia, and had the assistance when there of M. Richard (a
well-known French antiquary), made a collection of <em>objets d'art</em> some years
ago for the Science and Art Department, which is now in the Kensington
Museum, but it contains comparatively little that can be actually termed
furniture; and it is extremely difficult to meet with important specimens
of ornamental woodwork of native workmanship. Those in the Museum,
and in other collections, are generally small ornamental articles. The chief
reason for this is, doubtless, that little timber is to be found in Persia,
except in the Caspian provinces, where, as Mr. Benjamin has told us in
"Persia and the Persians," wood is abundant; and the Persian architect,
taking advantage of his opportunity, has designed his houses with wooden
piazzas&mdash;not found elsewhere&mdash;and with "beams, lintels, and eaves
quaintly, sometimes elegantly, carved, and tinted with brilliant hues."
Another feature of the decorative woodwork in this part of Persia is that
produced by the large latticed windows, which are well adapted to the
climate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>In the manufacture of textile fabrics&mdash;notably, their famous carpets
of Yezd and Ispahan, and their embroidered cloths in hammered and
engraved metal work, and formerly in beautiful pottery and porcelain&mdash;they
have excelled, and good examples will be found in the South Kensington
Museum. It is difficult to find a representative specimen of Persian
furniture except a box or a stool; and the illustration of a brass incense
burner is, therefore, given to mark the method of native design, which was
adopted in a modified form by the Persians from their Arab conquerors.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_137.jpg" width="329" height="480" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>I<span class="smcapa">NCENSE</span> B<span class="smcapa">URNER</span> <span class="smcapa">OF</span> E<span class="smcapa">NGRAVED</span> B<span class="smcapa">RASS</span>.</p>

<p><em>In the South Kensington Museum.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>This method of design has one or two special characteristics which
are worth noticing. One of these was due to the teaching of Mahomet
forbidding animal representation in design&mdash;a rule which in later work has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
been relaxed; another was the introduction of mathematics into Persia by
the Saracens, which led to the adoption of geometrical patterns in design;
and a third, the development of "Caligraphy" into a fine art, which has
resulted in the introduction of a text, or motto, into so many of the
Persian designs of decorative work. The combination of these three
characteristics was the origin of the "Arabesque" form of ornament,
which, in artistic nomenclature, occurs so frequently.</p>

<p>The general method of decorating woodwork is similar to the Indian
method, and consists in either inlaying brown wood (generally teak) with
ivory or pearl in geometrical patterns, or in covering the wooden box,
or manuscript case, with a coating of lacquer, somewhat similar to the
Chinese or Japanese preparations. On this groundwork some good
miniature painting was executed, the colors being, as a rule, red, green,
and gold, with black lines to give force to the design.</p>

<p>The author of "Persia and the Persians," already quoted, had, during
his residence in the country, as American Minister, great opportunities of
observation, and in his chapter entitled "A Glance at the Arts of Persia,"
he has said a good deal of this mosaic work. Referring to the scarcity of
wood in Persia, he says: "For the above reason one is astonished at the
marvellous ingenuity, skill and taste developed by the art of inlaid work,
or mosaic in wood. It would be impossible to exceed the results
achieved by the Persian artisans, especially those of Shiraz, in this
wonderful and difficult art.... Chairs, tables, sofas, boxes, violins,
guitars, canes, picture frames, almost every conceivable object, in fact,
which is made of wood, may be found overlaid with an exquisite casing
of inlaid work, so minute sometimes that thirty-five or forty pieces may
be counted in the space of a square eighth of an inch. I have counted
four hundred and twenty-eight distinct pieces on a square inch of a
violin, which is completely covered by this exquisite detail of geometric
designs, in mosaic."</p>

<p>Mr. Benjamin&mdash;who, it will be noticed, is somewhat too enthusiastic
over this kind of mechanical decoration&mdash;also observes that, while the
details will stand the test of a magnifying glass, there is a general
breadth in the design which renders it harmonious and pleasing if looked
at from a distance.</p>

<p>In the South Kensington Museum there are several specimens of
Persian lacquer work, which have very much the appearance of those
papier maché articles that used to be so common in England some forty
years ago, save that the decoration is, of course, of Eastern character.</p>

<p>Of seventeenth century work, there is also a fine coffer, richly
inlaid with ivory, of the best description of Persian design and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
workmanship of this period, which was about the zenith of Persian Art
during the reign of Shah Abbas. The numerous small articles of what is
termed Persian marqueterie, are inlaid with tin wire and stained ivory, on
a ground of cedar wood, very similar to the same kind of ornamental
work already described in the Indian section of this chapter. These
were purchased at the Paris Exhibition in 1867.</p>

<p>Persian Art of the present day may be said to be in a state of
transition, owing to the introduction and assimilation of European ideas.</p>


<h5>SARACENIC WOODWORK FROM CAIRO AND DAMASCUS.</h5>

<p>The changes of fashion in Western, as contrasted with Eastern,
countries are comparatively rapid. In the former, the record of two or
three centuries presents a history of great and well-defined alterations in
manners, customs, and, therefore, in furniture: while the more conservative
Oriental has been content to reproduce, from generation
to generation, the traditions of his forefathers; and we find that,
from the time of the Moorish conquest and spread of Arabesque design,
no radical change in Saracenic Art occurred until French and English
energy and enterprise forced European fashions into Egypt. As a consequence,
the original quaintness and orientalism natural to the country,
are being gradually replaced by buildings, decoration, and furniture of
European fashion.</p>

<p>The carved pulpit, from a mosque in Cairo, which is in the South
Kensington Museum, was made for Sultan Kaitbeg, 1468-96. The side
panels, of geometrical pattern, though much injured by time and wear,
shew signs of ebony inlaid with ivory, and of painting and gilding; they
are good specimens of the kind of work. The two doors, also from
Cairo, the oldest parts of which are just two hundred years earlier than
the pulpit, are exactly of the same style, and, so far as appearances go,
might just as well be taken for two hundred years later, so conservative
was the Saracenic treatment of decorative woodwork for some four or five
centuries. Pentagonal and hexagonal mosaics of ivory, with little mouldings,
of ebony dividing the different panels, the centres of eccentric shapes of
ivory or rosewood carved with minute scrolls, combine to give these
elaborate doors a very rich effect, and remind one of the work still to be
seen at the Alhambra, in Granada.</p>

<p>Shewing a Window of Arab Lattice Work, similar to that of the Damascus Room in the
South Kensington Museum.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Science and Art Department has been fortunate in securing from
the St. Maurice and Dr. Meymar Collections, a great many specimens
which are well worth examination. The most remarkable is a complete
room brought from a house in Damascus, which is fitted up in the
Oriental style, and gives one a good idea of an Eastern interior. The
walls are decorated in color and gold; the spaces are divided by flat
pilasters; and there are recesses, or cupboards, for the reception of
pottery, quaintly formed vessels, and pots of brass. Oriental carpets,
octagonal tables, such as the one which ornaments the initial letter
of this chapter, hookas, incense burners, and cushions furnish the
apartment; while the lattice window is an excellent representation of the
"Mesherabijeh," or lattice work with which we are familiar since so much
has been imported by Egyptian travellers. In the upper panels of the
lattice there are inserted pieces of colored glass, and, looking outwards
towards the light, the effect is very pretty. The date of this room is
1756, which appears at the foot of an Arabic inscription, of which a
translation is appended to the exhibit. It commences:&mdash;"In the Name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate," and concludes, "Pray, therefore,
to Him morning and evening."</p>

<p>A number of bosses and panels, detached from their original
framework, are also to be seen, and are good specimens of Saracenic
design. A bedstead, with inlay of ivory and numerous small squares
of glass, under which are paper flowers, is also a fair sample of native
work.</p>

</div>

<p>The illustration on page <a href="#Page_142">142</a> is of a carved wood door from Cairo,
considered by the South Kensington authorities to be of Syrian work.
It shews the turned spindles, which the Arabs generally introduce into
their ornamental woodwork; and the carving of the vase of flowers is a
good specimen of its kind. The date is about the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>For those who would gain an extended knowledge of Saracenic or
Arabian Art industry, "<cite>L'Art Arabe</cite>," by M. Prisse d'Aveunes, should be
consulted. There will be found in this work many carefully-prepared
illustrations of the cushioned seats, the projecting balconies of the
lattice work already alluded to, of octagonal inlaid tables, and such
other articles of furniture as were used by the Arabs. The South
Kensington Handbook, "Persian Art," by Major-General Murdoch Smith,
R.E., is also a very handy and useful work in a small compass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>While discussing Saracenic or Arab furniture, it is worth noticing
that our word "sofa" is of Arab derivation, the word "suffah" meaning
"a place or couch for reclining before the door of Eastern houses."
In Skeat's Dictionary the word is said to have first occurred in the
"Guardian," in the year 1713, and the phrase is quoted from No. 167 of
that old periodical of the day&mdash;"He leapt off from the sofa on which
he sat."</p>

<p>From the same source the word "ottoman," which Webster defines
as "a stuffed seat without a back, first used in Turkey," is obviously
obtained, and the modern low-seated upholsterer's chair of to-day is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
doubtless the development of a French adaptation of the Eastern cushion
or "divan," this latter word having become applied to the seats which
furnished the hall or council chamber in an Eastern palace, although its
original meaning was probably the council or "court" itself, or the hall
in which such was held.</p>

<p>Thus do the habits and tastes of different nations act and re-act
upon each other. Western peoples have carried eastward their civilization
and their fashions, influencing Arts and industries with their
restless energy, and breaking up the crust of Oriental apathy and
indolence; and have brought back in return the ideas gained from an
observation of the associations and accessories of Eastern life, to adapt
them to the requirements and refinements of European luxury.</p>

<p><span class="figleft100"><img src="images/i_145.jpg" width="180" height="300" alt="T" /></span>HERE is something so distinct in the
development of taste in furniture, marked
out by the three styles to which the three
monarchs have given the names of "Louis
Quatorze," "Louis Quinze," and "Louis
Seize," that it affords a fitting point for a
new departure.</p>

<p>This will be evident to anyone who
will visit, first the Palace of Versailles,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
then the Grand Trianon, and afterwards
the Petit Trianon. By the help of a few
illustrations, such a visit in the order given,
would greatly interest anyone having even a
smattering of knowledge of the characteristic
ornaments of these different periods.
A careful examination would demonstrate
how the one style gradually merged into
that of its successor. Thus the massiveness
and grandeur of the best Louis Quatorze
<em>meubles de luxe</em> became, in their later development, too ornate and
effeminate, with an elaboration of enrichment, culminating in the rococo
style of Louis Quinze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>Then we find in the "Petit Trianon," and also in the Château
of Fontainebleau, the purer taste of Marie Antoinette dominating the
Art productions of her time, which reached their zenith, with regard
to furniture, in the production of such elegant and costly examples as
have been preserved to us in the beautiful work-table and secretaire&mdash;sold
some years since at the dispersion of the Hamilton Palace Collection&mdash;and
in some other specimens which may be seen in the Musée du Louvre,
in the Jones Collection in the South Kensington Museum, and in other
public and private Collections. Several illustrations of these examples will
be found in this chapter.</p>

<p>We have to recollect that the reign of Louis XIV. was the time of
the artists Berain, Lebrun, and, later in the reign, of Watteau, also of
André Charles Boule, <em>ciseleur et doreur du roi</em>, and of Colbert, that
admirable Minister of Finance, who knew so well how to second his royal
master's taste for grandeur and magnificence. The Palace of Versailles
bears throughout the stamp and impress of the majesty of <em>le Grande
Monarque;</em> and the rich architectural ornament of the interior, with
moulded, gilded, and painted ceilings, required the furnishing to be carried
to an extent which had never been attempted previously.</p>

<p>Louis XIV. had judgment in his taste, and he knew that, to carry
out his ideas of a royal palace, he must not only select suitable artists
capable of control, but he must centralize their efforts. In 1664 Colbert
founded the Royal Academy of Painting, Architecture, and Sculpture,
into which designs of furniture were admitted. The celebrated Gobelins
tapestry factory was also established; and it was here that the King
collected together, and suitably housed, the different skilled producers of
his furniture, placing them all under the control of his favourite artist,
Lebrun, who was appointed director in 1667.</p>

<p>The most remarkable furniture artist of this time, for surely he
merits such title, was Andre Charles Boulle, generally spelt Boule. He
was born in 1642, and, therefore, was 25 years of age when Lebrun
was appointed Art-director. He appears to have originated the method
of ornamenting furniture which has since been associated with his name.
This was to veneer his cabinets, pedestals, armoires, encoignures, clocks,
and brackets with tortoise-shell, into which a cutting of brass was laid,
the latter being cut out from a design, in which were harmoniously
arranged scrolls, vases of flowers, satyrs, animals, cupids, swags of fruit
and draperies. Fantastic compositions of a free Renaissance character
constituted the panels; to which bold scrolls in ormolu formed fitting
frames; while handsome mouldings of the same material gave a finish
to the extremities. These ormolu mountings were gilt by an old-fashioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
process,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> which left upon the metal a thick deposit of gold, and were
cunningly chiselled by the skilful hands of Caffieri or his contemporaries.</p>

<p>P<span class="smcapa">ERIOD</span>: L<span class="smcapa">OUIS</span> XIV.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Boule subsequently learned to economise labour by adopting a similar
process to that used by the marqueterie cutter; and by glueing together
two sheets of brass, or white metal, and two of shell, and placing over
them his design, he was then able to pierce the four layers by one cut
of the bandsaw; this gave four exact copies of the design. The same
process would be repeated for the reverse side, if, as with an armoire or
a large cabinet, two panels, one for each door, right and left, were
required; and then, when the brass, or white metal cutting was fitted
into the shell so that the joins were imperceptible, he would have two right-hand
and two left-hand panels. These would be positive and negative: in
the former pair the metal would represent the figured design with the
shell as groundwork, and the latter would have the shell as a design,
with a ground of metal. The terms positive and negative are the writer's
to explain the difference, but the technical terms are "first part" and
"second part," or "Boule" and "counter." The former would be
selected for the best part of the cabinet; for instance, the panels of the
front doors, while the latter would be used for the ends or sides. An
illustration of this plan of using all four cuttings of one design, occurs in
the armoire No. 1026 in the Jones Collection, and in a great many other
excellent specimens. The brass, or the white metal in the design, was
then carefully and most artistically engraved; and the beauty of the
engraving of Boule's finest productions is a great point of excellence,
giving, as it does, a character to the design, and emphasizing its details.
The mounting of the furniture in ormolu, of a rich and highly-finished
character, completed the design. The <em>Musée du Louvre</em> is rich in examples
of Boule's work: and there are some very good pieces in the Jones
Collection, at Hertford House, and at Windsor Castle.</p>

<p>The illustration on page <a href="#Page_144">144</a> is the representation of an armoire, which
was, undoubtedly, executed by Boule from a design by Lebrun: it is
one of a pair which was sold in 1882, at the Hamilton Palace sale, by
Messrs. Christie, for £12,075. Another small cabinet, in the same
collection, realised £2,310. The pedestal cabinet illustrated on page <a href="#Page_148">148</a>,
from the Jones Collection, is very similar to the latter, and cost Mr. Jones
£3,000. When specimens, of the genuineness of which there is no
doubt, are offered for sale, they are sure to realize very high prices.
The armoire in the Jones Collection, already alluded to (No. 1026), of
which there is an illustration, cost Mr. Jones between £4,000 and £5,000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>In some of the best of Boule's cabinets, as, for instance, in the
Hamilton Palace armoire (illustrated), the bronze gilt ornaments stand
out in bold relief from the surface. In the Louvre there is one which
has a figure of <em>le Grand Monarque</em>, clad in armour, with a Roman toga,
and wearing the full bottomed wig of the time, which scarcely accords
with the costume of a Roman general. The absurd combination which
characterizes this affectation of the classic costume is also found in
portraits of our George II.</p>

<p>(<em>South Kensington Museum.</em>)</p></div>
</div>

<p>The masks, satyrs, and rams' heads, the scrolls of the foliage, are
also very bold in specimens of this class of Boule's work; and the "sun"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
(that is, a mask with rays of light radiating from it) is a very favourite
ornament of this period.</p>

<p>Boule had four sons and several pupils; and he may be said to have
founded a school of decorative furniture, which had its votaries and
imitators now, as it had in its own time. The word one frequently
finds misspelt "Buhl," and the term has come to represent any similar
mode of decoration of furniture, no matter how meretricious or common
it may be.</p>

<p>(<em>From a Miniature dated 1696.</em>)</p></div>
</div>

<p>Later in the reign of Louis XIV., as other influences were brought to
bear upon the taste and fashion of the day, this style of furniture became
more ornate and showy. Instead of the natural color of the shell, either
vermilion or gold leaf was placed underneath the transparent shell; the
gilt mounts became less severe, and abounded with the curled endive
ornament, which afterwards became thoroughly characteristic of the fashion
of the succeeding reign; and the forms of the furniture itself followed the
taste for a more free and flowing treatment; and it should be mentioned,
in justice to Lebrun, that from the time of his death and the appointment
of his successor, Mignard, a distinct decline in merit can be traced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>Contemporary with Boule's work, were the richly-mounted tables,
having slabs of Egyptian porphyry, or Florentine marble mosaic; and
marqueterie cabinets with beautiful mountings of ormolu, or gilt bronze.
Commodes and screens were ornamented with Chinese lacquer, which
had been imported by the Dutch and taken to Paris, after the French
invasion of the Netherlands.</p>

</div>

<p>About this time&mdash;that is, towards the end of the seventeenth century&mdash;the
resources of designers and makers of decorative furniture were
reinforced by the introduction of glass in larger plates than had been
possible previously. Mirrors of considerable size were first made in
Venice; these were engraved with figures and scrolls, and mounted in
richly carved and gilt wood frames. Soon afterwards manufactories
of mirrors, and of glass, in larger plates than before, were set up in
England, near Battersea, and in France, at Tour la Ville, near Paris.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
This novelty not only gave a new departure to the design of suitable
frames in carved wood (generally gilt), but also to that of Boule work
and marqueterie. It also led to a greater variety of the design for
cabinets; and from this time we may date the first appearance of the
"Vitrine," or cabinet with glass panels in the doors and sides, for the
display of smaller <em>objets d'art</em>.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>DECORATION OF A SALON IN LOUIS XIV. STYLE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The chairs and sofas of the latter half of the reign of Louis
Quatorze are exceedingly grand and rich. The suite of furniture for the
state apartment of a prince, or wealthy nobleman, comprised a <em>canapé</em>, or
sofa, and six <em>fauteuils</em>, or arm chairs, the frames carved with much spirit,
or with "feeling," as it is technically termed, and richly gilt. The backs
and seats were upholstered and covered with the already famous tapestry
of Gobelins or Beauvais. A short account of these factories will be
found in the Appendix.</p>

<p>Such a suite of furniture, in bad condition and requiring careful and
very expensive restoration, was sold at Christie's some time ago for about
£1,400, and it is no exaggeration to say that a really perfect suite, with
carving and gilding at the best, and the tapestry not too much worn,
if offered for public competition, would probably realize between £3,000
and £4,000.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>In the Appendix will be found the names of many artists in furniture
of this time, and in the Jones Collection we have several very excellent
specimens which can be easily referred to, and compared with others
of the two succeeding reigns, whose furniture we are now going to
consider.</p>

<p>As an example of the difference in both outline and detail which
took place in design, let the reader notice the form of the Louis
Quatorze commode vignetted for the initial letter of this chapter, and
then turn to the lighter and more fanciful cabinets of somewhat similar
shape, which will be found illustrated in the "Louis Quinze" section
which follows this. In the Louis Quatorze cabinets the decorative effect,
so far as the woodwork is concerned, was obtained first by the careful
choice of suitable veneers, and then by joining four pieces in a panel,
so that the natural figure of the wood runs from the centre, and then
a banding of a darker wood forms a frame. An instance of this will
also be found in the above-mentioned vignette.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>


<h5>LOUIS XV.</h5>

<p>When the old King died, at the ripe age of 77, the crown devolved
on his great-grandson, then a child five years old, and therefore, a
Regency became necessary; and this period of some eight years, until the
death of Philip, Duke of Orleans, in 1723, when the King was declared
to have attained his majority at the age of 13, is known as <em>l'Epoch de la
Régence</em>, and is a landmark in the history of furniture.</p>

</div>

<p>There was a great change about this period of French history in
the social condition of the upper classes in France. The pomp and
extravagance of the late monarch had emptied the coffers of the noblesse,
and in order to recruit their finances, marriages became common which a
decade or two before that time would hardly have been thought possible.
Nobles of ancient lineage married the daughters of bankers and speculators,
in order to supply themselves with the means of following the extravagant
fashions of the day, and we find the wives of ministers of departments
of State using their influence and power for the purpose of making
money by gambling in stocks, and accepting bribes for concessions and
contracts.</p>

<p>It was a time of corruption, extravagance, licentiousness, and
intrigue, and although one might ask what bearing this has upon the
history of furniture, a little reflection shows that the abandonment of
the great State receptions of the late King, and the pompous and
gorgeous entertainments of his time, gave way to a state of society in
which the boudoir became of far more importance than the salon, in
the artistic furnishing of a fashionable house. Instead of the majestic
grandeur of immense reception rooms and stately galleries, we have the
elegance and prettiness of the boudoir; and as the reign of the young
King advances, we find the structural enrichment of rooms more free, and
busy with redundant ornament. The curved endive decoration, so common
in carved woodwork and its imitation in "compo." of this period is seen
everywhere; in the architraves, in the panel mouldings, in the frame of
an overdoor, in the design of a mirror frame; doves, wreaths, Arcadian
fountains, flowing scrolls, Cupids, and heads and busts of women
terminating in foliage, are carved or moulded in relief, on the walls, the
doors, and the alcoved recesses of the reception rooms, either gilded or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
painted white; and pictures by Watteau, Lancret, or Boucher, and their
schools, are appropriate accompaniments.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>(<em>Collection of M. Double, Paris.</em>)</p></div>
</div>

<p>The furniture was made to agree with this decorative treatment;
couches and easy chairs were designed in more sweeping curves and on a
smaller scale, the woodwork wholly or partially gilt and upholstered, not
only with the tapestry of Gobelins, Beauvais, and Aubusson, but with
soft colored silk brocades and brocatelles; light occasional chairs were
enriched with mother-of-pearl or marqueterie; screens were painted with
love scenes and representations of ladies and gentlemen who look as if
they passed their entire existence in the elaboration of their toilettes or
the exchange of compliments; the stately cabinet is modified into the
<em>bombé</em> fronted commode, the ends of which curve outwards with a graceful
sweep; and the bureau is made in a much smaller size, more highly
decorated with marqueterie, and more fancifully mounted to suit the
smaller and more effeminate apartment. The elegant cabinet, called
<em>Bouheur du jour</em> (a little cabinet mounted on a table); the small round
occasional table, called a <em>guéridon;</em> the <em>encoignure</em>, or corner cabinet; the
<em>étagère</em>, or ornamental hanging cabinet with shelves; the three-fold screen,
with each leaf a different height, and with shaped top, all date from this
time. The <em>chaise à porteur</em>, or Sedan chair, on which so much work and
taste were expended, became more ornate, so as to fall in with the
prevailing fashion. Marqueterie became more fanciful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>The Louis Quinze cabinets were inlaid, not only with natural woods,
but with veneers stained in different tints; and landscapes, interiors,
baskets of flowers, birds, trophies, emblems of all kinds, and quaint
fanciful conceits are pressed into the service of marqueterie decoration.
The most famous artists in this decorative woodwork were Riesener, David
Roentgen (generally spoken of as David), Pasquier, Carlin, Leleu, and
others, whose names will be found in a list in the Appendix.</p>

<p>During the preceding reign, the Chinese lacquer-work then in use
was imported from the East, the fashion for collecting which had
set in ever since the Dutch had established a trade with China; and
subsequently as the demand arose for smaller pieces of <em>meubles de luxe</em>,
collectors had these articles taken to pieces, and the slabs of lacquer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
mounted in panels to decorate the table, or cabinet, and to display the
lacquer. <em>Ébenistes</em>, too, prepared such parts of woodwork as were desired
to be ornamented in this manlier, and sent them to China to be coated
with lacquer, a process which was then only known to the Chinese;
but this delay and expense quickened the inventive genius of the
European, and it was found that a preparation of gum and other
ingredients applied again and again, and each time carefully rubbed down,
produced a surface which was almost as lustrous and suitable for
decoration as the original article. A Dutchman named Huygens was the
first successful inventor of this preparation; and owing to the adroitness
of his work, and of those who followed him and improved his process,
one can only detect European lacquer from Chinese by noting certain
trifling details in the costumes and foliage of decoration, not strictly
Oriental in character.</p>

<p>About 1740-4 the Martin family had three manufactories of this peculiar
and fashionable work, which became known as Vernis-Martin, or Martins'
Varnish; and it is a singular coincidence that one of these was in the district
of Paris then and now known as Faubourg Saint Martin. By a special
decree a monopoly was granted in 1744 to Sieur Simon Etienne Martin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
the younger, "To manufacture all sorts of work in relief and in the style
of Japan and China." This was to last for twenty years; and we shall
see that in the latter part of the reign of Louis XV., and in that of his
successor, the decoration was not confined to the imitation of Chinese
and Japanese subjects, but the surface was painted in the style of the
decorative artist of the day, both in monochrome and in natural colors;
such subjects as "Cupid Awakening Venus," "The Triumph of Galatea,"
"Nymphs and Goddesses," "Garden Scenes," and "Fêtes Champêtres,"
being represented in accordance with the taste of the period. It may
be remarked in passing, that lacquer work was also made previous to this
time in England. Several cabinets of "Old" English lac are included in
the Strawberry Hill sale catalogue; and they were richly mounted with
ormolu, in the French style; this sale took place in 1842. George
Robins, so well known for his flowery descriptions, was the auctioneer;
the introduction to the catalogue was written by Harrison Ainsworth.</p>

<p>The gilt bronze mountings of the furniture of this time became less
massive and much more elaborate; the curled endive ornament was very
much in vogue; the acanthus foliage followed the curves of the commode;
busts and heads of women, cupids, satyrs terminating in foliage, suited
the design and decoration of the more fanciful shapes; and Caffieri, who
is the great master of this beautiful and highly ornate enrichment,
introduced Chinese figures and dragons into his designs. The amount of
spirit imparted into the chasing of this ormolu is simply marvellous&mdash;it
has never been equalled, and could not be excelled. Time has now
mellowed the color of the woodwork it adorns; and the tint of the gold
with which it is overlaid, improved by the lights and shadows caused by
the high relief of the work and the consequent darkening of the parts
more depressed, while the more prominent ornaments have been rubbed
bright from time to time, produces an effect which is exceedingly elegant
and rich. One cannot wonder that connoisseurs are prepared to pay
such large sums for genuine specimens, or that clever imitations are
extremely costly to produce.</p>

<p>Illustrations are given from some of the more notable examples of
decorative furniture of this period, which were sold in 1882 at the
celebrated Hamilton Palace sale, together with the sums they realised; also
of specimens in the South Kensington Museum, in the Jones Collection.</p>

<p>We must also remember, in considering the <em>meubles de luxe</em> of this
time, that in 1753 Louis XI. had made the Sêvres Porcelain Manufactory
a State enterprise; and later, as that celebrated undertaking progressed,
tables and cabinets were ornamented with plaques of the beautiful and
choice <em>páte tendre</em>, the delicacy of which was admirably adapted to
enrich the light and frivolous furnishing of the dainty boudoir of a
Madame du Barri or a Madame Pompadour.</p>

<p>Another famous artist in the delicate bronze mountings of the day was
Pierre Gouthière. He commenced work some years later than Caffieri,
being born in 1740; and, like his senior fellow craftsman, did not
confine his attention to furniture, but exercised his fertility of design, and
his passion for detail, in mounting bowls and vases of jasper, of Sêvres
and of Oriental porcelain. The character of his work is less forcible than
that of Caffieri, and comes nearer to what we shall presently recognise
as the Louis Seize or Marie Antoinette style, to which period his work
more properly belongs. In careful finish of minute details, it more
resembles the fine goldsmith's work of the Renaissance.</p>

<p>Gouthière was employed extensively by Madame du Barri; and at her
execution, in 1793, he lost the enormous balance of 756,000 francs, which
was due to him, but which debt the State repudiated, and the unfortunate
man died in extreme poverty, the inmate of an almshouse.</p>

<p>The designs of the celebrated tapestry of Gobelins and of Beauvais,
used for the covering of the finest furniture of this time, also underwent
a change; and instead of the representation of the chase, with a bold
and vigorous rendering, we find shepherds and shepherdesses, nymphs
and satyrs, the illustrations of La Fontaine's fables or renderings of
Boucher's pictures. The arm chair, or <em>fauteuil</em>, with upholstered instead of
open sides, was introduced into the suite of tapestry furniture, and the
term by which it is known, "<em>chaise bergère</em>," seems to be a sign of the
fashion of the day.</p>

<p>Without doubt, the most important examples of <em>meubles de luxe</em> of this
reign is the famous "Bureau du Roi," made for Louis XV. in 1769, and
which is fully described in the inventory of the "Garde Meuble" in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
the year 1775, under No. 2541. The description is very minute, and is
fully quoted by M. Williamson in his valuable work, "Les Meubles d'Art
du Mobilier National," occupying in space no less than thirty-seven lines
of printed matter. Its size is five and a half feet long and three feet deep;
the lines are the perfection of grace and symmetry; the marqueterie is in
Riesener's best manner; the mountings are magnificent&mdash;reclining figures,
foliage, laurel wreaths, and swags, chased with rare skill. The back of
this famous bureau is as fully decorated as the front: it is signed,
"Riesener, f. e., 1769, á l'arsenal de Paris." Riesener is said to have
received the order for this celebrated piece of furniture&mdash;of which a full-page
illustration is given&mdash;from the King in 1767, upon the occasion of
the marriage of this favourite Court <em>ébeniste</em> with the widow of his
former master Oeben. Its production, therefore, would seem to have
occupied about two years.</p>

<p>This celebrated chef d'œuvre was in the Tuileries in 1807, and was
included in the inventory found in the cabinet of Napoleon I. It was
moved by Napoleon III. to the Palace of St. Cloud, and was only
saved from capture by the Germans by its removal to its present
home in the Louvre in August, 1870. It is said that it would probably
realise, if now offered for sale, between fifteen and twenty thousand pounds.</p>

<p>A similar bureau is in the Hertford Wallace collection, which was
made to the order of Stanilaus, King of Poland; and a copy of it,
executed by Zwiener, a very clever <em>ébeniste</em> of the present day in Paris,
at a cost of some three thousand pounds, is in the same collection.
Between the publishing of the third and fourth editions of this book,
this valuable collection, under the will of the late Lady Wallace, passed
into the possession of the English nation, and the fine specimens of
furniture which it contains are now available for reference.</p>


<h5>LOUIS XVI. AND MARIE ANTOINETTE.</h5>

<p>It is probable that for some little time previous to the death of
Louis XV., the influence of the beautiful daughter of Maria Theresa on
the fashions of the day was manifested in furniture and its accessories.
We know that Marie Antoinette disliked the pomp and ceremony of
Court functions, and preferred a simpler way of living at the favourite
farm house which was given to her husband as a residence, on his
marriage, four years before his accession to the throne; and here she
delighted to mix with the <em>bourgeoisie</em> on the terrace at Versailles, or
donning a simple dress of white muslin, would busy herself in the
garden or dairy. There was, doubtless, something of the affectation of
a woman spoiled by admiration, in thus playing the rustic: still, one
can understand that the best French society, weary of the domination
of the late King's mistresses, with their intrigues, their extravagances,
and their creatures, looked forward, at the death of Louis, with hope
and anticipation to the accession of his grandson and the beautiful
young queen.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>Gradually, under the new régime, architecture became more simple.
Broken scrolls were replaced by straight lines, curves and arches were
introduced when justified, and columns and pilasters reappeared in the
ornamental façade of public buildings. Interior decoration necessarily
followed suit: instead of the curled endive scrolls enclosing the irregular
panel, and the superabundant foliage in ornament, we find rectangular
panels formed by simpler mouldings, with broken corners, having a patera
or rosette in each, and between the upright panels there is a pilaster of
refined Renaissance design. In the oval medallions supported by cupids,
is found a domestic scene by Fragonard or Chardin; and portraits of
innocent children by Greuze replaced the courting shepherds and
mythological goddesses of Boucher and Lancret. Sculpture, too, became
more refined and decorous in its representations.</p>

<p>As with architecture, decoration, painting and sculpture, so also with
furniture. The designs became more simple, but were relieved from
severity by the amount of ornament, which, except in some cases where
it was over-elaborate, was properly subordinate to the design and did not
control it.</p>

<p>Mr. Hungerford Pollen attributes this revival of classic taste to the
discoveries of ancient treasures in Herculaneum and Pompeii, but, as these
occurred in the former city so long before the time we are discussing
as the year 1711, and in the latter as 1750, they can scarcely be the
immediate cause; the reason most probably is that a return to simpler
and purer lines came as a relief and reaction from the over-ornamentation
of the previous period. There are not wanting, however, in some of
the decorated ornaments of the time distinct signs of the influence of
these discoveries. Drawings and reproductions from frescoes, found in
these old Italian cities, were in the possession of the draughtsmen and
designers of the time; and an instance in point of their adaptation is to
be seen in the small boudoir of the Marquise de Serilly, one of the maids
of honour to Marie Antoinette. The decorative woodwork of this boudoir
is fitted up in the Kensington Museum.</p>

<p>A notable feature in the ornament of woodwork and in metal
mountings of this time, is a fluted pilaster with quills or husks
filling the flutings some distance from the base, or starting from both
base and top and leaving an interval of the fluting plain and without
ornament. An example of this will be seen in the next woodcut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
of a cabinet in the Jones Collection, which has also the familiar
"Louis Seize" riband, surmounting the two oval Sêvres china plaques.
When the flutings are in oak, in rich mahogany, or painted white,
these husks are gilt, and the effect is chaste and pleasing. Variation was
introduced into the gilding of frames by mixing silver with some portion
of the gold, so as to produce two tints, red gold and green gold: the latter
would be used for wreaths and accessories, while the former, or ordinary
gilding, was applied to the general surface. The legs of tables were
generally fluted, as noted above, tapering towards the feet, and were
relieved from a stilted appearance by being connected by a stretcher.</p>

<p>There occurs in M. Williamson's valuable contribution to the literature
of our subject ("<cite>Les Meubles d'Art du Mobilier National</cite>,") an interesting
illustration of the gradual alterations which we are noticing as having taken
place in the design of furniture. This is a small writing table, some
3ft. 6in. long, made during the reign of Louis XV., but quite in the Marie
Antoinette style, the legs tapering and fluted, the frieze having in the
centre a plaque of <em>bronze doré</em>, the subject being a group of cupids,
representing the triumph of Poetry, and having on each side a scroll with
a head and foliage (the only ornament characteristic of Louis Quinze
style) connecting leg and frieze. It was made for the Trianon, and the
date is just one year after Marie Antoinette's marriage. M. Williamson
quotes verbatim the memorandum of which it was the subject:&mdash;"Memoire
des ouvrages faits et livrés, par les ordres de Monsieur le
Chevalier de Fontanieu, pour le garde meuble du Roy par Riesener,
ébeniste a l'arsenal Paris," savoir Sept. 21, 1771; and then follows a
fully detailed description of the table, with its price, which was 6,000
francs, or £240. An illustration of this table precedes this page.</p>

<p>The maker of this piece of furniture was the same Riesener whose
masterpiece is the magnificent <em>Bureau du Roi</em> in the Louvre, to which we
have already alluded. This celebrated <em>ébeniste</em> continued to work for Marie
Antoinette for about twenty years, until she quitted Versailles, and he
probably lived quite to the end of the century, for during the Revolution
we find that he served on the Special Commission appointed by the
National Convention to decide which works of Art should be retained,
and which should be sold, out of the mass of treasure confiscated after
the deposition and execution of the King.</p>

<p>Riesener's designs do not shew much variety, but his work is highly
finished and elaborate. His method was generally to make the centre
panel of a commode front, or the frieze of a table, a <em>tour de force</em>, the
marqueterie picture being wonderfully delicate. The subject was generally
a vase with fruits and flowers; the surface of the side panels was inlaid
with diamond-shaped lozenges, or a small diaper pattern in marqueterie;
and then a framework of rich ormolu would separate the panels. The
centre panel had sometimes a richer frame. His famous commode, made
for the Château of Fontainebleau, which cost a million francs (£4,000)&mdash;an
enormous sum in those days&mdash;is one of his <em>chefs d'œuvres</em>, and is
an excellent example of his style. A similar commode was sold in the
Hamilton Palace sale for £4,305. An upright secretaire, <em>en suite</em> with the
commode, was also sold at the same time for £4,620, and the writing
table for £6,000. An illustration of the latter is on the following page,
but the details of this elaborate gem of cabinet maker's work, and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Gouthière's skill in mounting, are almost impossible to represent in a
woodcut. It is described as follows in Christie's catalogue:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lot 303. An oblong writing table <em>en suite</em>, with drawer fitted with
inkstand, writing slide and shelf beneath; an oval medallion of a trophy
and flowers on the top, and trophies with four medallions round the sides:
stamped T. Riesener and branded underneath with cypher of Marie
Antoinette, and <em>Garde Meuble de la Reine</em>." There is no date on the table,
but the secretaire is stamped 1790, and the commode 1791. If we assume
that the table was produced in 1792, then these three specimens, which
have always been regarded as amongst the most beautiful work of the
reign, were almost the last which the unfortunate Queen lived to see
completed.</p>

<p>The fine work of Riesener required to be mounted by an artist of
equal merit, and in Gouthière he was most fortunate. There is a famous
clock case in the Hertford or Wallace collection, fully signed "Gouthière,
ciseleur et doreur du roi à Paris Quai Pelletier, á la Boucle d'or, 1771."
Gouthière worked, however, chiefly in conjunction with Riesener and David
Roentgen for the adornment of their marqueterie.</p>

<p>In the Louvre are some beautiful examples of this co-operative work;
and also of cabinets, in which plaques of very fine black and gold lacquer
take the place of marqueterie; the centre panel being a finely chased
oval medallion of Gouthière's gilt bronze, with caryatides figures of the
same material at the ends supporting the cornice.</p>

<p>A specimen of this kind of work (an upright secretaire, of which we
have not been able to obtain a satisfactory representation) formed part
of the Hamilton Palace Collection, and realised £9,450, the highest price
which the writer has ever seen a single piece of furniture bring by
auction; it may be regarded as the <em>chef d'œuvre</em> of Gouthière.</p>

<p>In the Jones Collection, at South Kensington, there are also several
charming examples of Louis Seize <em>meubles de luxe</em>. Some of these are
enriched with plaques of Sêvres porcelain, to which the more jewel-like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
mounting of this time is better adapted than the rococo style which was
in vogue during the preceding reign.</p>

<p>The upholstered furniture became simpler in design; the sofas and
chairs have generally, but not invariably, straight fluted tapering legs,
which sometimes have the flutings spiral instead of perpendicular: the
backs are either oval or rectangular, and ornamented with a carved riband
which is represented as tied at the top in a lover's knot. Gobelins,
Beauvais, and Aubusson tapestry are used for covering, the subjects
being in harmony with the taste of the time. A sofa in this style, with
settees at the ends, the frame elaborately carved with trophies of arrows
and flowers in high relief, and covered with fine old Gobelins tapestry,
was sold at the Hamilton Palace Sale for £1,176. This was formerly at
Versailles. Beautiful silks and brocades were also extensively used, both
for chairs and for the screens, which, at this period, were varied in
design and extremely pretty. Small two-tier tables of tulip wood with
delicate mountings were quite the rage. The legs of small occasional
pieces, like those of the chairs, are occasionally carved. An excellent
example of a piece with cabriole legs is the charming little "Marie
Antoinette" cylinder-fronted marqueterie escritoire in the Jones Collection
(illustrated below). The marqueterie is attributed to Riesener, but from
its treatment being so different from that which, as an almost invariable
rule, he adopted, it is more probably the work of David.</p>

<p>The influence exercised by the splendour of the Court of Louis
Quatorze, and by the bringing together of artists and skilled handi-craftsmen
for the adornment of the palaces of France, which we have
seen took place during the latter half of the seventeenth century, was
not without its effect upon the Industrial Arts of other countries.
Macaulay mentions the "bales of tapestry" and other accessories which
were sent to Holland to fit up the camp quarters of Louis le Grand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
when he went there to take the command of his army against
William III., and he also tells us of the sumptuous furnishing of the
apartments at St. Germains when James II., during his exile, was the
guest of Louis. The grandeur of the French King impressed itself
upon his contemporaries, and war with Germany, as well as with
Holland and England, helped to spread this influence. We have noticed
how Wren designed the additions to Hampton Court Palace in imitation
of Versailles: and in the chapter which follows this, it will be seen that
the designs of Chippendale were really reproductions of French furniture
of the time of Louis Quinze. The King of Sweden, Charles XII., "the
Madman of the North," as he was called, imitated his great French
contemporary, and in the palace at Stockholm there are still to be seen
traces of the Louis Quatorze style in decoration and in furniture; such
adornments are out of keeping with the simplicity of the habits of the
present Royal family of Sweden.</p>

<p>A Bourbon Prince, too, succeeded to the throne of Spain in 1700,
and there are still in the palaces and picture galleries of Madrid some
fine specimens of French furniture of the three reigns which have just
been discussed. It may be taken, therefore, that for a period dating from
the latter part of the seventeenth century, the dominant influence upon
the design of decorative furniture was of French origin.</p>

<p>There is evidence of this influence in a great many examples of the
work of Flemish, German, English, and Spanish cabinet makers. Some
of these are worthy of mention, and will repay a careful examination.
One of them is a corner cupboard of rosewood, inlaid with engraved
silver, part of the design being a shield with the arms of an Elector
of Cologne; there is also a pair of somewhat similar cabinets from the
Bishop's Palace at Salzburg. These are of German work, early eighteenth
century, and have evidently been designed after Boule's productions.
The shape and the gilt mounts of a secretaire of walnutwood with inlay
of ebony and ivory, and some other furniture also, which, with the
specimens just described, may be seen in the Bethnal Green Museum,
all manifest the influence of the French school, when the bombé-fronted
commodes and the curved lines of chairs and tables came into fashion.</p>

<p>Having described somewhat in detail the styles which prevailed and
some of the changes which occurred in France, from the time of
Louis XIV. until the Revolution, it is unnecessary, for the purposes of
this sketch, to do more than briefly refer to the work of those countries
which may be said to have adopted, to a greater or less extent, French
designs. For reasons already stated, an exception is made in the case
of our own country; and the following chapter will be devoted to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
furniture designed and made by some of the English craftsmen of the
latter half of the eighteenth century. Of Italy it may be observed
generally that the Renaissance of Raffaelle, Leonardo da Vinci, and
Michael Angelo, which we have seen became degenerate towards the
end of the sixteenth century, relapsed still further during the period
which we have just been discussing; and, although the freedom and
grace of the Italian carving, and the elaboration of inlaid arabesques,
must always have some merit of their own, the work of the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries in Italy will compare very unfavourably with
that of the earlier period of the Renaissance.</p>

<p>There are many other museum specimens which might be referred to,
proving the influence of French design of the seventeenth and subsequent
centuries on that of other countries. The above illustration of a Norse
interior shews that this influence penetrated as far as Scandinavia;
the old-fashioned box-like bedsteads which the Norwegians had retained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
from early times, and which in a ruder form are still to be found in the
cottages of many Scottish counties, especially of those where the Scandinavian
connection existed, are characteristic of the country. The design
of the chairs in the preceding illustration is an evidence of the innovations
which had been made upon native fashions. These chairs are in style
thoroughly Dutch, of about the end of the seventeenth, or early in the
eighteenth century; the cabriole legs and shell ornaments were probably
the direct result of the influence of the French on the Dutch. The
woodcut is from a drawing of an old house in Norway.</p>

<p>It would be unfitting to close this chapter on French furniture
without paying tribute to the munificence and public spirit of Mr.
John Jones, whose bequest to the South Kensington Museum constitutes
in itself a representative Museum of this class of decorative furniture.
Several of the illustrations in this chapter have been taken from this
collection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>The money value alone of this collection of furniture, porcelain,
bronzes, and <em>articles de vertû</em>, mostly of the period embraced within the
limits of this chapter, amounts to about £400,000, and exceeds the value
of any bequest the nation has ever had. Perhaps the references contained
in these few pages, to the French furniture of this time, may stimulate
the interest of the public in, and its appreciation of, this valuable national
property.</p>

<p>Soon after this generous bequest was placed in the South Kensington
Museum, for the benefit of the public, a leading article appeared in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
<em>Times</em>, from which the following extract will very appropriately conclude
this chapter:&mdash;"As the visitor passes by the cases where these curious
objects are displayed, he asks himself what is to be said on behalf of
the art of which they are such notable examples. Tables, chairs,
commodes, secretaires, wardrobes, porcelain vases, marble statuettes, they
represent in a singularly complete way the mind and the work of the
<em>ancien régime</em>. Like Eisen's vignettes, or the <em>contes</em> of innumerable story-tellers,
they bring back to us the grace, the luxury, the prettiness, the
frivolity of that Court which believed itself, till the rude awakening came,
to contain all that was precious in the life of France. A piece of furniture
like the little Sêvres-inlaid writing table of Marie Antoinette is, to employ
a figure of Balzac's, a document which reveals as much to the social
historian as the skeleton of an ichthyosaurus reveals to the palæontologist.
It sums up an epoch. A whole world can be inferred from it. Pretty,
elegant, irrational, and entirely useless, this exquisite and costly toy might
stand as a symbol for the life which the Revolution swept away."</p>

<p><span class="figleft100"><img src="images/i_173.jpg" width="139" height="300" alt="S" /></span>OON after the second half of the eighteenth
century had set in, during the latter days of the
second George, and the early part of his successor's
long reign, there is a distinct change in the
design of English decorative furniture.</p>

<p>Sir William Chambers, R.A., an architect, who
has left us Somerset House as a lasting monument
of his talent, appears to have been the first to
impart to the interior decoration of houses what
was termed "the Chinese style," as the result of
his visit to China, of which a notice was made in
the chapter on Eastern furniture; and as he was
considered an "oracle of taste" about this time,
his influence was very powerful. Chair backs consequently
have the peculiar irregular lattice work
which is seen in the fretwork of Chinese and
Japanese ornaments; and Pagodas, Chinamen and
monsters occur in his designs for cabinets. The
overmantel which had hitherto been designed with
some architectural pretension, now gave way to the larger mirrors which
were introduced by the improved manufacture of plate glass; and the
chimney piece became lower. During his travels in Italy, Chambers had
found some Italian sculptors, and had brought them to England, to carve
in marble his designs; they were generally of a free Italian character,
with scrolls of foliage and figure ornaments: but being of stone instead
of woodwork, they scarcely belong to our subject, save to indicate the
change in fashion of the chimney piece, the vicissitudes of which we have
already noticed. Chimney pieces were now no longer specially designed
by architects, as part of the interior fittings, but were made and sold with
the grates, to suit the taste of the purchaser, often quite irrespective of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the rooms for which they were intended. It may be said that Dignity
gave way to Elegance.</p>

<p>Robert Adam, having returned from his travels in France and Italy,
had designed and built, in conjunction with his brother James, Adelphi
Terrace, about 1769, and subsequently Portland Place, and other streets
and houses of a like character; the furniture being made under the
direction of Robert, to suit the interiors. There is much interest attaching
to No. 25, Portland Place, because this was the house built, decorated
and furnished by Robert Adam for his own residence, and, fortunately,
the chief reception rooms remain to show the style then in vogue.
The brothers Adam introduced into England the application of composition
ornaments to woodwork. Festoons of drapery, wreaths of flowers caught
up with rams' heads, or of husks tied with a knot of riband, and oval
patent to mark divisions in a frieze, or to emphasize a break in the
design, are ornaments characteristic of what was termed the Adams style.</p>

<p>Robert Adam published between 1778 and 1822, in three magnificent
volumes, "Works in Architecture." One of these was dedicated to King
George III., to whom he was appointed Architect. Many of his designs
for furniture was carried cut by Gillows; there is a good collection of
his original drawings in the Soane Museum, Lincoln's Inn Fields.</p>

<p>The decoration was generally in low relief, with fluted pilasters,
and sometimes a rather stiff Renaissance ornament decorating the panel;
the effect was neat and chaste, and a distinct change from the rococo
style which had preceded it.</p>

<p>The design of furniture was modified to harmonize with such decoration.
The sideboard had a straight and not infrequently a serpentine-shaped
front, with square tapering legs, and was surmounted by a pair of
urn-shaped knife cases, the wood used being almost invariably mahogany
with the inlay generally of plain flutings relieved by fans or oval paterœ
in satin wood.</p>

<p>Piranesi, Cipriani and Angelica Kauffmann had been attracted to
England by the promise of lucrative employment, and not only decorated
the panels of ceilings and walls which were enriched by Adams's "<em>compo</em>."
(in reality a revival of the old Italian gesso work), but also painted the
ornamental cabinets, occasional tables, and chairs of the time. Some of
the work of Angelica Kauffmann as a decorative artist may still be seen
in several houses in Adelphi Terrace, in the Arts Club, and in many
private residences, of which there is a very useful list in Miss Frances
Gerard's biography of the artist, published in 1892.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>Towards the end of the century, satin wood was introduced into
England from the East Indies; it became very fashionable, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
a favourite ground-work for decoration, the medallions of figure subjects,
generally of cupids, wood-nymphs, or illustrations of mythological fables,
on darker colored wood, formed an effective relief to the yellow satin
wood. Sometimes the cabinet, writing table, or spindle-legged occasional
piece was made entirely of this wood, having no other decoration beyond
the beautiful marking of carefully-chosen veneers; sometimes it was
banded with tulipwood or harewood (a name given to sycamore artificially
stained), and at other times painted as just described. A very beautiful
example of this last-named treatment is the dressing table in the South
Kensington Museum, which we give as an illustration on the opposite
page.</p>

<p>Besides Chambers, there were several other architects who designed
furniture about this time who have been almost forgotten. Abraham Swan,
some of whose designs for wooden chimney pieces in the quasi-classic
style are given, flourished about 1758. John Carter, who published
"Specimens of Ancient Sculpture and Painting"; Nicholas Revitt and
James Stewart, who jointly published "Antiquities of Athens" in 1762;
J. C. Kraft, who designed in Robert Adam's style; W. Thomas, M.S.A.,
and others, have left us many drawings of interior decorations, chiefly
chimney pieces and the ornamental architraves of doors, all of them in
low relief and of a classical character, as was the fashion towards the
end of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>Josiah Wedgwood, too, turned his attention to the production of
plaques in relief, for adaptation to chimney pieces of this character.
In a letter written from London to Mr. Bentley, his partner, at the
works, he deplores the lack of encouragement in this direction which
he received from the architects of his day; he, however, persevered,
and by the aid of Flaxman's inimitable artistic skill as a modeller,
made several plaques of his beautiful jasper ware, which were let in to
the friezes of chimney pieces, and also into other woodwork. There can
be seen in the South Kensington Museum a pair of pedestals of this
period (1770-1790) so ornamented.</p>

<p>It is now necessary to consider the work of a group of English
cabinet makers, who not only produced a great deal of excellent furniture,
but who also published a large number of designs drawn with extreme
care and a considerable degree of artistic skill.</p>

<p>The first of these, and the best known, was Thomas Chippendale, who
is said to have been born in Worcester. He appears to have succeeded
his father, a chair maker, and to have carried on a large and successful
business in St. Martin's Lane, London, which was at this time an important
Art centre, and close to the newly-founded Royal Academy.</p>

<p>Chippendale published "The Gentleman and Cabinet Maker's
Director," not, as stated in the introduction to the catalogue to the
South Kensington Museum, in 1769, but some years previously, as is
testified by a copy of the "third edition" of the work, which is in the
writer's possession and bears date 1762, the first edition having appeared
in 1754. The title page of this edition is reproduced in <em>fac-simile</em> on

</div>

<p>This valuable work of reference contains over two hundred copper-plate
engravings of chairs, sofas, bedsteads, mirror frames, girandoles,
torchères or lamp stands, dressing tables, cabinets, chimney pieces,
organs, jardinières, console tables, brackets, and other useful and
decorative articles, of which some examples are given. It will be observed
from these that the designs of Chippendale are very different from those
popularly ascribed to him. Indeed it would appear that this maker has
become better known than any other, from the fact of the designs in his
book having been recently republished in various forms; his popularity has
thus been revived, while the names of his contemporaries are forgotten. For
the last fifteen or twenty years, therefore, during which time the fashion
has obtained of collecting the furniture of a bygone century, almost every
cabinet, table, or mirror frame, presumably of English manufacture, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
is slightly removed from the ordinary type of domestic furniture, has
been, for want of a better title, called "Chippendale." As a matter
of fact, he appears to have adopted from Chambers the fanciful Chinese
ornament, and the rococo style of that time, which was superseded some
five-and-twenty years later by the quiet and more classic designs of
Adam and his contemporaries.</p>

<p>Carved in the French style. (From Chippendale's "Director.")</p></div>
</div>

<p>In the chapter on Louis XV. and Louis XVI. furniture, it has been
shewn how French fashion went through a similar change about this same
period. In Chippendale's chairs and console tables, in his state bedsteads
and his lamp-stands, one can recognize the broken scrolls and curved
lines, so familiar in the bronze mountings of Caffieri. The influence of the
change which had occurred in France during the Louis Seize period is
equally evident in Adam's treatment. It was helped forward by the migration
into this country of skilled workmen from France, during the troubles of
the revolution at the end of the century. Some of Chippendale's designs
bear such titles as "French chairs" or a "Bombé-fronted Commode."
These might have appeared as illustrations in a contemporary book
on French furniture, so identical are they in every detail with the carved
woodwork of Picau, of Canner, or of Nilson, who designed the flamboyant
frames of the time of Louis XV. Other designs have more individuality.
In his mirror frames he introduced a peculiar bird with a long snipe-like
beak and rather impossible wings, an imitation of rockwork and dripping
water, Chinese figures with pagodas and umbrellas; and sometimes the
illustration of Æsop's fables interspersed with scrolls and flowers. By
dividing the glass unequally, by the introduction into his design of
bevelled pillars with carved capitals and bases, he produced a quaint and
pleasing effect, very suitable to the rather effeminate fashion of his time,
and in harmony with three-cornered hats, wigs and patches, embroidered
waistcoats, knee breeches, silk stockings, and enamelled snuff-boxes.
In some of the designs there is a fanciful Gothic, to which he makes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
special allusion in his preface, as likely to be considered by his critics
as impracticable, but which he undertakes to produce if desired&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Though some of the profession have been diligent enough to
represent them (espescially those after the Gothick and Chinese manner)
as so many specious drawings impossible to be worked off by any
mechanick whatsoever. I will not scruple to attribute this to Malice,
Ignorance, and Inability; and I am confident I can convince all
Noblemen, Gentlemen, or others who will honour me with their
Commands, that every design in the book can be improved, both as
to Beauty and Enrichment, in the execution of it, by</p>

<p>The reader will notice that in the examples selected from Chippendale's
book there are none of those fretwork tables and cabinets
which are generally termed "Chippendale." We know, however, that
besides the designs which have just been described, and which were
intended for gilding, he also made mahogany furniture, and in the
"Director" there are drawings of chairs, washstands, writing-tables
and cabinets of this description. Fretwork is seldom seen, but
the carved ornament is generally a foliated or curled endive scroll;
sometimes the top of a cabinet is finished in the form of a Chinese
pagoda. Upon examining a piece of furniture that may reasonably be
ascribed to him, it will be found to be of excellent workmanship, and the
wood, always mahogany without any inlay, is richly marked, shewing a
careful selection of material.</p>

<p>The chairs of Chippendale and his school are very characteristic.
If the outline of the back of some of them be compared with the
stuffed back of the chair from Hardwick Hall (illustrated in Chap. IV.)
it will be seen that the same lines occur, but instead of the frame of
the back being covered with silk, tapestry, or other material&mdash;as in
William III.'s time&mdash;Chippendale's are cut open into fanciful patterns;
and in his more highly ornate work, the twisted ribands of his design
are scarcely to be reconciled with the use for which a dining room chair
is intended. The well-moulded sweep of his lines, however, counter-balances
this defect to some extent, and a good Chippendale mahogany
chair will ever be an elegant article of furniture.</p>

<p>One of the most graceful chairs of about the middle of the century,
in the style of Chippendale's best productions, is the Master's Chair in
the Hall of the Barbers' Company. It is carved in rich Spanish mahogany,
and upholstered in morocco leather; the ornament consists of scrolls and
cornucopiæ with flowers charmingly disposed, the arms and motto of
the Company being introduced. Unfortunately, there is no certain record<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
as to the designer and maker of this beautiful chair, and it is to be
regretted that the date (1865), the year when the Hall was redecorated,
should have been placed in prominent gold letters on this interesting
relic of a past century.</p>

<p>Apart from the several books of design noticed in this chapter, there
were published two editions of a work, undated, containing many of the
drawings found in Chippendale's book. This book was entitled, "Upwards
of One Hundred New and Genteel Designs, being all the most approved
patterns of household furniture in the French taste. By a Society of
Upholders and Cabinet makers." It is probable that Chippendale was
a member of this Society, and that some of the designs were his, but
that he severed himself from it, and published his own book, preferring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
to advance his individual reputation. The "sideboard" which one so
generally hears called "Chippendale" scarcely existed in his time. If
it did it must have been quite at the end of his career. There were
side tables, sometimes called "Side-Boards," but they contained neither
cellaret nor cupboard; only a drawer for table linen.</p>

<p>The name of Robert Manwaring should not be omitted as one of
Chippendale's contemporaries. He published "The Chairmaker's Guide"
in 1766, which included "upwards of two hundred new and genteel
designs, both decorative and plain, of all the most approved patterns for
burjairs, toillets, cornishes and lanthorns, etc."</p>

<p>The patterns of his chair-backs are very similar to those of his
contemporaries, and four of his designs which were reproduced in
"Furniture and Decoration," two years ago, only differ in detail from
those illustrated here as the work of Ince and Mayhew. Manwaring also
designed china cabinets, fenders, balconies, and other decorative items, and
he is believed to have been a leading member of the Society of
Upholders and Cabinet Makers, alluded to in page <a href="#Page_182">182</a>.</p>

<p>Two other designers and makers of mahogany ornamental furniture,
who also deserve special mention in the discussion of eighteenth century
English furniture, are W. Ince and J. Mayhew, who were partners in
business in Broad Street, Golden Square, and contemporary with Chippendale.
They also published a book of designs,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> which is alluded to by Thomas
Sheraton in the preface to his "Cabinet Maker and Upholsterer's
Drawing Book," published in 1793. A few examples from Ince and
Mayhew's "Cabinet Maker's Real Friend and Companion" are given,
from which it is evident that, without any distinguishing brand, or
without the identification of any particular piece of furniture with one
of their designs, it is difficult to distinguish between their work and
that of Chippendale and other contemporary makers.</p>

<p>It is, however, noticeable, after careful comparison of the work of
Chippendale with that of Ince and Mayhew, that the furniture designed
and made by the latter has many more of the characteristic details and
ornaments which are now generally looked upon as denoting the work of
Chippendale; for instance, the fretwork ornaments finished by the carver,
and then applied to the plain mahogany; the open-worked scroll shaped
backs to encoignures or china shelves; and the carved Chinaman with
the pagoda. Some of the frames of chimney glasses and pictures made
by Ince and Mayhew are almost identical with those attributed to
Chippendale.</p>

<p>Other well known designers and manufacturers of this time were
Hepplewhite, who published a book of designs very similar to those of
his contemporaries, and Matthias Lock, some of whose original drawings
were on view in the Exhibition of 1862,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> with interesting memoranda
attached, giving the names of his workmen and the wages paid: from
these it would appear that five shillings a day was at that time sufficient
remuneration for a skilful wood carver.</p>

<p>Another good designer and maker of much excellent furniture of
this time was "Shearer," who has been unnoticed by nearly all writers
on the subject. In an old book of designs in the author's possession,
"Shearer delin" and "published according to Act of Parliament, 1788,"
appears underneath the representations of sideboards, tables, bookcases,
dressing tables, which are very similar in every way to those of
Sheraton, his contemporary. George Richardson and Matthias Darly
should also be mentioned as notable designers of furniture and
decorative details of this time.</p>

<p>A copy of Hepplewhite's Book, in the author's possession (published
in 1789), contains 300 designs "of every article of household furniture
in the newest and most approved taste," and it is worth while to quote
from his preface to illustrate the high esteem in which English cabinet
work was held at this time.</p>

<p>"English taste and workmanship have of late years been much
sought for by surrounding nations; and the mutability of all things,
but more especially of fashions, has rendered the labours of our predecessors
in this line of little use; nay, in this day can only tend to
mislead those foreigners who seek a knowledge of English taste in the
various articles of household furniture."</p>

<p>It is amusing to think how soon the "mutabilities of fashion" did
for a time supersede many of his designs.</p>

<p>A selection of drawings from his book is given, and it will be useful
to compare them with those of other contemporary makers. From
such a comparison it will be seen that in the progress from the rococo
of Chippendale to the more severe lines of Sheraton, Hepplewhite forms
a connecting link between the two.</p>

<p>The names given to some of these designs appear curious; for instance:</p>

<p>"Rudd's table or reflecting dressing table," so called from the first
one having been invented for a popular character of that time.</p>

<p>"Knife cases," for the reception of the knives which were kept in
them and used to "garnish" the sideboards.</p>

<p>"Cabriole chair," implying a stuffed back, and not having reference,
as it does now, to the curved form of the leg.</p>

<p>"Bar backed sofa," being what we should now term a three or four
chair settee, <em>i.e.</em>, like so many chairs joined and having an arm at either end.</p>

<p>"Library case" instead of Bookcase.</p>

<p>"Confidante" and "Duchesse," which were sofas of the time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>"Gouty stool," a stool having an adjustable top.</p>

<p>"Tea chest," "Urn stand," and other names which have now
disappeared from ordinary use in describing similar articles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>Hepplewhite had a "<em>specialité</em>," to which he alludes in his book, and
of which he gives several designs. This was his japanned or painted
furniture; the wood was coated with a preparation after the manner of
Chinese or Japanese lacquer, and then decorated, generally with gold on a
black ground, the designs being in fruits and flowers: and also medallions
painted in the style of Cipriani and Angelica Kauffmann. Subsequently,
furniture of this character, instead of being japanned, was only painted
white. It is probable that many of the chairs of this time which one
now sees to be of wood of inferior quality, and with scarcely any ornament,
were originally decorated in the manner just described, and therefore the
"carving" of details would have been superfluous. Injury to the enamelling,
by wear and tear, was most likely the cause of their being stripped of
their rubbed and partly obliterated decorations, and they were then stained
and polished, presenting an appearance which is scarcely just to the
designer and manufacturer.</p>

<p>In some of Hepplewhite's chairs, too, as in those of Sheraton, one
may fancy he sees evidence of the squabbles of two fashionable factions
of this time, "the Court party" and the "Prince's party," the latter
having the well-known Prince of Wales' plumes very prominent, and
forming the ornamental support of the back of the chair. Another
noticeable enrichment is the carving of wheat ears on the shield shape
backs of the chairs.</p>

<p>To convey an idea of the fashion of the day, "the plan of a room
shewing the proper distribution of the furniture," appears on page <a href="#Page_193">193</a>. It is
evident from the large looking glass which overhangs the sideboard that
the fashion had now set in to use these mirrors. Some thirty or forty
years later this mirror became part of the sideboard, and, in some
large and pretentious designs which we have seen, the sideboard
itself was little better than the support of a huge glass in a heavily
carved frame.</p>

<p>The dining tables of this period deserve a passing notice as a step
in the development of that important member of our "Lares and
Penates." What was, and is still, called the "pillar and claw" table, came
into fashion towards the end of the last century. It consisted of a round
or square top supported by an upright cylinder, which rested on a plinth
having three, or sometimes four, feet carved as claws. In order to
extend these tables for a larger number of guests, an arrangement was
made for placing several together. When apart, they served as pier or
side tables, and some of these&mdash;the two end ones, being semi-circular&mdash;may
still be found in some of our old inns.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>It was not until the year 1800 that Richard Gillow, of the well-known
firm in Oxford Street, invented and patented the convenient telescopic
contrivance which, with slight improvements, has given us the table of the
present day. The term still used by auctioneers in describing a modern
extending table as a "set of dining tables," is, probably, a survival of the
older method of providing for a dinner party. Gillow's patent is described<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
as "an improvement in the method of constructing dining and other
tables calculated to reduce the number of legs, pillars, and claws, and
to facilitate and render easy, their enlargement and reduction."</p>

<p>(<em>From "Hepplewhite's Guide."</em>)</p></div>
</div>

<p>As an interesting link between the present and the past, it may be
useful here to introduce a slight notice of this well-known firm of
furniture manufacturers, for which the writer is indebted to Mr. Clarke,
one of the present partners of Gillows. "We have an unbroken record
of books dating from 1724, but we existed long anterior to this: all
records were destroyed during the Scottish Rebellion in 1745. The house
originated in Lancaster, which was then the chief port in the north,
Liverpool not being in existence at the time, and Gillows exported
furniture largely to the West Indies, importing rum as payment, for
which privilege they held a special charter. The house opened in London
in 1765, and for some time the Lancaster books bore the heading and
inscription, 'Adventure to London.' On the architect's plans for the
premises now so well known in Oxford Street, occur these words, 'This
is the way to Uxbridge.'" Mr. Clarke's information may be supplemented
by adding that from Dr. Gillow, whom the writer had the pleasure of
meeting some years ago, and who was the thirteenth child of the Richard
Gillow before mentioned, he learnt that this same Richard Gillow retired
in 1830, and died as lately as 1866 at the age of 90. Dowbiggin, founder
of the firm of Holland and Sons, was an apprentice to Richard Gillow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>Mahogany may be said to have come into general use subsequent to
1720, and its introduction is asserted to have been due to the tenacity of
purpose of a Dr. Gibbon, whose wife wanted a candle box, an article of
common domestic use of the time. The Doctor, who had laid by in the
garden of his house in King Street, Covent Garden, some planks sent to
him by his brother, a West Indian captain, asked a joiner to use a part
of the wood for this purpose; it was found too tough and hard for the
tools of the period, but the Doctor was not to be thwarted, and insisted
on harder-tempered tools being found, and the task was completed; the
result was the production of a candle box which was admired by every
one. He then ordered a bureau of the same material, and when it was
finished, he invited his friends to see the new work; amongst others, the
Duchess of Buckingham begged a small piece of the precious wood, and
it soon became the fashion. On account of its toughness, and peculiarity
of grain, it was capable of treatment impossible with oak, and the high
polish it took by oil and rubbing (not French polish, a later invention),
caused it to come into great request. The term "putting one's knees
under a friend's mahogany," probably dates from about this time.</p>

<p>Thomas Sheraton, who commenced work some twenty years later
than Chippendale, and continued in business until the early part of the
nineteenth century, accomplished much excellent work in English furniture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>The fashion had now changed; instead of the rococo&mdash;literally, rock
work and shell (<em>roequaille et coquaille</em>)&mdash;ornament, which had gone out, a
simpler and more severe taste had come in. In Sheraton's cabinets,
chairs, writing tables, and occasional pieces, we have therefore no longer
the cabriole leg or the carved ornament; but, as in the case of the
brothers Adam, and the furniture designed by them for such houses as
those in Portland Place, we have now square tapering legs, severe lines,
and quiet ornament. Sheraton trusted almost entirely for decoration to
his marqueterie. Some of this is very delicate and of excellent workmanship.
He introduced occasionally into his scrolls animals with foliated
extremities, and he also inlaid marqueterie trophies of musical instruments;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
but as a rule the decoration was in wreaths of flowers, husks, or drapery,
in strict adherence to the fashion of the decorations to which allusion has
been made. A characteristic feature of his cabinets was the swan-necked
pediment surmounting the cornice, being a revival of an ornament fashionable
during Queen Anne's reign. It was then chiefly found in stone,
marble, or cut brickwork, but subsequently became prevalent in inlaid
woodwork.</p>

<p>Designed by T. Sheraton, and published in his "Cabinet Maker and Upholsterer's Drawing Book," 1793.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Sheraton was apparently a man very well educated for his time,
whether self taught or not one cannot say; but that he was an excellent
draughtsman, and had a complete knowledge of geometry, is evident from
the skilful drawings in his book, and the careful though rather verbose
directions he gives for perspective drawing. Many of his numerous designs
for furniture and ornamental items are drawn to a scale with the
geometrical nicety of an engineer's or architect's plan. He has drawn in
elevation, plan, and minute detail, each of the five architectural orders.</p>

<p>The selection made here from his designs for the purposes of
illustration, is not taken from his later work, which properly belongs to
a future chapter, when we come to consider the influence of the
French Revolution, and the translation of the "Empire" style to England.
Sheraton published "The Cabinet Maker and Upholsterer's Drawing
Book" in 1793, and the list of subscribers whose names and addresses
are given, throws much light on the subject of the furniture of his
time.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Amongst these are many of his aristocratic patrons and no
less than 450 names and addresses of cabinet makers, chair makers, and
carvers, exclusive of harpsichord manufacturers, musical instrument makers,
upholsterers, and other kindred trades. Included with these we find the
names of firms who, from the appointments they held, it may be inferred,
had a high reputation for good work, and a leading position in the trade,
but who, perhaps from the absence of a taste for "getting into print"
and from the lack of any brand or mark by which their work can be
identified, have passed into oblivion while their contemporaries are still
famous. The following names taken from this list are probably those of
men who had for many years conducted well known and old established
businesses, but would now be but poor ones to "conjure" with: while
those of Chippendale, Sheraton, or Hepplewhite, are a ready passport
for a doubtful specimen. For instance:&mdash;France, Cabinet Maker to His
Majesty, St. Martin's Lane; Charles Elliott, Upholder to His Majesty
and Cabinet Maker to the Duke of York, Bond Street; Campbell and
Sons, Cabinet Makers to the Prince of Wales, Mary-le-bone Street,
London. Besides those who held Royal appointments, there were other
manufacturers of decorative furniture&mdash;Thomas Johnson, Copeland, Robert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Davy, a French carver named Nicholas Collet, who settled in England,
and many others.</p>

<p>In Mr. J. H. Pollen's larger work on furniture and woodwork, which
includes a catalogue of the different examples in the South Kensington
Museum, there is a list of the various artists and craftsmen who have
been identified with the production of artistic furniture either as designers
or manufacturers, and the writer has found this of considerable service.
In the Appendix to this work, this list has been reproduced, with the
addition of several names (particularly those of the French school)
omitted by Mr. Pollen, and it will, it is hoped, prove a useful reference
to the reader.</p>

<p>Although in deference to the prevailing taste for our National
manufacture of the latter half of the last century, this chapter is somewhat
long, on account of the endeavour to give more detailed information
about English furniture of that period, still, in concluding it, a few
remarks about the "Sideboard" may be allowed.</p>

<p>The changes in form and fashion of this important article of domestic
furniture are interesting, and to explain them a slight retrospect is
necessary. The word "Buffet," sometimes translated "Sideboard," which
was used to describe continental pieces of furniture of the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries, does not designate our Sideboard, which may be said
to have been introduced by William III., and of which kind there is
a fair specimen in the South Kensington Museum; an illustration of
it has been given in the chapter dealing with that period.</p>

<p>The term "stately sideboard" occurs in Milton's "Paradise Regained,"
which was published in 1671; and Dryden, in his translation of "Juvenal,"
published in 1693, when contrasting the furniture of the classical period
of which he was writing, with that of his own time, uses the following
line:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"No sideboards then with gilded plate were dressed."</p>

<p>The fashion in those days of having symmetrical doors in a room,
that is, false doors to correspond with the door used for exit, which
one still finds in many old houses in the neighbourhood of Portland
Place, and particularly in the Palaces of St. James' and of Kensington,
enabled our ancestors to have good cupboards for the storage of glass,
crockery, and reserve wine. After the middle of the eighteenth century,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
however, these extra doors and the cupboard enclosed by them, gradually
disappeared; and soon after the mahogany side table came into fashion,
it became the custom to supplement this article of furniture by an
independent pedestal cupboard on either side (instead of the cupboards
alluded to), one for hot plates and the other for wine. Then, as the thin
legs gave the table rather a lanky appearance, the <em>garde de vin</em>, or cellaret,
was added in the form of an oval tub of mahogany, with bands of brass,
sometimes raised on low feet with castors for convenience, which was used
as a wine cooler. A pair of urn-shaped mahogany vases stood on the
pedestals, and these contained&mdash;the one hot water for the servants' use
in washing the knives, forks, and spoons, which being then much more
valuable were limited in quantity, and the other held iced water for the
guests' use. To understand this arrangement the reader is referred to the
illustration on page <a href="#Page_193">193</a>.</p>

<p>A brass rail at the back of the side table, with ornamented pillars
and branches for candles, was used, partly to enrich the furniture, and
partly to form a support to the handsome pair of knife and spoon cases,
which completed the garniture of a gentleman's sideboard of this period.
It would therefore seem that the modern sideboard is the combination
of these separate articles into one piece of furniture&mdash;at different times
and in different fashions&mdash;first the pedestals joined to the table produced
our "pedestal sideboard," then the mirror was joined to the back, the
cellaret made part of the interior fittings, and the banishment of
knife cases and urns to the realms of the curiosity hunter, or for
conversion into spirit cases and stationery holders. The sarcophagus,
often richly carved, of course succeeded the simple cellaret of Sheraton's
period.</p>

<p>Before we dismiss the furniture of the "dining room" of this period,
it may interest some of our readers to know that until the first edition
of "Johnson's Dictionary" was published in 1755, the term was not to
be found in the vocabularies of our language designating its present use.
In Barrat's "Alvearic," published in 1580, "parloir," or "parler," was
described as "a place to sup in." Later, "Minsheu's Guide unto
Tongues," in 1617, gave it as "an inner room to dine or to suppe in,"
but Johnson's definition is "a room in houses on the first floor, elegantly
furnished for reception or entertainment."</p>

<p>To the latter part of the eighteenth century&mdash;the English furniture
of which time has been discussed in this Chapter&mdash;belong the quaint
little "urn stands" which were made to hold the urn with boiling
water, while the tea pot was placed on a little slide which is drawn
out from underneath the top. In those days tea was an expensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
luxury, and urn stands (illustrated below) were inlaid in the fashion of
the time. These, together with the old mahogany or marqueterie tea
caddies, which were sometimes the object of considerable skill and care,
are dainty relics of the past. One of these, designed by Chippendale,
as illustrated on page <a href="#Page_179">179</a>, and another by Hepplewhite will be found on
page <a href="#Page_194">194</a>. They were fitted with two and sometimes three bottles or tea
poys of silver or Battersea enamel, to hold the black and green teas, and
when really good examples of these daintily-fitted tea caddies are offered
for sale they bring large sums.</p>

</div>

<p>The "wine table" of this time deserves a word. These are now
somewhat rare, and are only to be found in a few old houses, and in
some of the Colleges at Oxford and Cambridge. These are fitted with
revolving tops, which had circles turned out to a slight depth for each
glass to stand in, and they were sometimes shaped like the half of a flat
ring. These latter were for placing in front of the fire, when the outer
side of the table formed a convivial circle, round which the sitters
gathered after they had left the dinner table.</p>

<p>One of these old tables is still to be seen in the Hall of Gray's Inn,
and the writer was told that its fellow was broken and had been "sent
away." They are nearly always of good rich mahogany, and have legs
more or less ornamental according to circumstances.</p>

<p>A distinguishing feature of English furniture of the eighteenth century
was the partiality for secret drawers and contrivances for hiding away papers
or valued articles; and in old secretaires and writing tables we find a
great many ingenious designs which remind us of the days when there
were but few banks, and people kept money and deeds in their own
custody.</p>

the period discussed in this chapter, is referred to the exhaustive work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>

<p class="p6">EMPIRE FURNITURE.</p>


<p><span class="figleft100"><img src="images/i_203.jpg" width="162" height="300" alt="T" /></span>HERE are great crises in the history of a nation
which stand out in prominent relief. One of
these is the French Revolution, which commenced
in 1792, and wrought such dire havoc amongst
the aristocracy, with so much misery and distress
throughout that country. It was an event of
great importance, whether we consider the religion,
the politics, or the manners and customs of a
people, as affecting the changes in the style of
the decoration of their homes. The horrors of
the Revolution are matters of common knowledge
to every schoolboy, and there is no need to dwell
either upon them or their consequences, which are
so thoroughly apparent. To the confiscation of
the property of those who had fled the country,
was added the general dislocation of everything
connected with the work of the industrial arts.</p>

<p>Nevertheless it should be borne in mind that amongst the anarchy
and disorder of this terrible time in France, the National Convention had
sufficient foresight to appoint a Commission, composed of competent men
in different branches of Art, to determine what State property in artistic
objects should be sold, and what was of sufficient historical interest to
be retained as a national possession. Riesener, the celebrated <em>ébeniste</em>,
whose work we have described in the chapter on Louis Seize furniture,
and David, the famous painter of the time, both served on this Commission,
of which they must have been valuable members.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a passage in an article on "Art," by a democratic French
writer, as early as 1790&mdash;when the great storm cloud was already
threatening to burst&mdash;which is quoted by Mr. C. Perkins, the American
translator of Dr. Falke's German work, "Kunst im Hause," and gives
us the keynote to the great change which took place in the fashion of
furniture about the time of the Revolution:&mdash;"We have changed
everything; freedom, now consolidated in France, has restored the pure
taste for the antique! Farewell to your marqueterie and Boule, your
ribbons, festoons, and rosettes of gilded bronze; the hour has come when
objects must be made to harmonize with circumstances."</p>

<p>Thus it is hardly too much to say that designs were governed by
the politics and philosophy of the day; and one finds in furniture of this
period, the reproduction of ancient Greek forms for chairs and couches;
ladies' work tables, too, are fashioned somewhat after the old drawings of
sacrificial altars; and the classical tripod is a favourite support. The
mountings represent antique Roman fasces with an axe in the centre;
trophies of lances, surmounted by a Phrygian cap of liberty; winged
figures, emblematic of freedom; and antique heads of helmeted warriors
arranged like cameo medallions.</p>

<p>After the execution of Robespierre, and the abolition of the Revolutionary
Tribunal in 1794, came the establishment of the Directory; and
then, after Buonaparte's brilliant success in Italy, and the famous expeditions
to Syria and Egypt two years later, came his proclamation as First
Consul in 1799, which, in 1802, was confirmed as a life appointment.</p>

<p>We have only to refer to the portrait of the great soldier, represented
with the crown of bay leaves and other attributes of the old Roman
imperialism, to see that in his mind was the ambition of reviving much
of the splendour and of the surroundings of the Cæsars, whom he took,
to some extent, as his models; and that in founding on the ashes of the
Revolution a new fabric, with new people about him, all influenced by his
energetic personality, he desired to mark his victories by stamping the
new order of things with his powerful and assertive individualism.</p>

<p>The cabinet which was designed and made for Marie Louise, on his
marriage with her in 1810, is an excellent example of the Napoleonic
furniture. The wood used for this style of furniture was almost invariably
rich mahogany, the color of which made a good ground for the bronze
gilt mounts which were applied. The full-page illustration shews these
mountings, which are all classical in character; and though there is no
particular grace in the outline or form of the cabinet, there is a certain
dignity and solemnity, relieved from oppressiveness by the fine chasing
and gilding of the metal enrichments, and the excellent color and
figuring of the rich Spanish mahogany used. This cabinet, and several
other more or less ornate pieces of Napoleonic furniture, may still be seen
in the Chateau of Fontainebleau.</p>

<p>On secretaires and tables, a common ornament of this description of
furniture, is a column of mahogany, with a capital and base of bronze
(either gilt, part gilt, or green), in the form of the head of a sphinx with
the foot of an animal; console tables are supported by sphinxes and
griffins: and candelabra and wall brackets for candles, have winged figures
of females, stiff in modelling and constrained in attitude, but almost
invariably of good material with careful finish.</p>

<p>The bas-reliefs in metal which ornament the panels of the friezes of
cabinets, or the marble bases of clocks, are either reproductions of
mythological subjects from old Italian gems and seals, or represent the
battles of the Emperor, in which Napoleon is portrayed as a Roman
general. There was plenty of room to replace so much that had
disappeared during the Revolution, and a vast quantity of decorative
furniture was made during the few years which elapsed before the disaster
of Waterloo caused the disappearance of a power which had been almost
meteoric in its career.</p>

<p>One of the best authorities on "Empire Furniture" is the book of
designs published in 1809 by the architects Percier and Fontaine. It
is the more valuable, as a work of reference, from the fact that every
design represented was actually carried out, and is not a mere exercise of
fancy, as is the case with many such books. In the preface the authors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
modestly state that they are entirely indebted to the antique for the
reproduction of the different ornaments; and the originals, from which
some of the designs were taken, are still preserved in a fragmentary form
in the Museum of the Vatican.</p>

<p>The illustration on page <a href="#Page_205">205</a> of an arm chair and a stool, together with
that of the tripod table which ornaments the initial letter of this chapter,
are favourable examples of the richly-mounted and more decorative
furniture of this style. While they are not free from the stiffness and
constraint which are inseparable from classic designs as applied to
furniture, the rich color of the mahogany, the high finish and good
gilding of the bronze mounts, and the costly silk with which they are
covered, render them attractive and give them a value of their own.</p>

<p>The more ordinary furniture, however, of the same style, but without
these decorative accessories, is stiff, ungainly, and uncomfortable, and
seems to remind us of a period in the history of France when political
and social disturbance deprived the artistic and pleasure-loving Frenchman
of his peace of mind, distracting his attention from the careful consideration
of his work. It may be mentioned here that, in order
to supply a demand which has lately arisen, chiefly in New York, but
also to some extent in England, for the best "Empire" furniture, the
French dealers have bought up some of the old undecorated pieces,
and by ornamenting them with gilt bronze mounts, cast from good old
patterns, have sold them as original examples of the <em xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">meubles de luxe</em> of
the period.</p>

<p>In Dutch furniture of this time one sees the reproduction of the
Napoleonic fashion&mdash;the continuation of the Revolutionists' classicalism.
Many marqueterie secretaires, tables, chairs, and other like articles, are
mounted with the heads and feet of animals, with lion's heads and
sphinxes, designs which could have been derived from no other source;
and the general design of the furniture loses its bombé form, and becomes
rectangular and severe. Whatever difficulty there may be in sometimes
deciding between the designs of the Louis XIV. period, towards its close,
and that of Louis XV., there can be no mistake about <em xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">l'epoch de la
Directoire</em> and <em xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">le style de l'Empire</em>. These are marked and branded with
the Egyptian expedition, and the Syrian campaign, as legibly as if they
all bore the familiar plain Roman N, surrounded by a laurel wreath,
or the Imperial eagle which had so often led the French legions to
victory.</p>

<p>It is curious to notice how England, though so bitterly opposed to
Napoleon, caught the infection of the dominant features of design which
were prevalent in France about this time.</p>

<p>Design published by T. Sheraton, April, 1804.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Thus, in Sheraton's Book on Furniture, to which allusion has been
made, and from which illustrations have been given in the chapter on
"Chippendale and his Contemporaries," there is evidence that, as in France
during the influence of Marie Antoinette, there was a classical revival,
and the lines became straighter and more severe for furniture, so this
alteration was adopted by Sheraton, Shearer and other English designers
at the end of the century. But if we refer to Sheraton's later drawings,
which are dated about 1804 to 1806, we see the constrained figures and
heads and feet of animals, all brought into the designs as shewn in the
"drawing room" chairs here illustrated. These shew unmistakable signs
of the French "Empire" influence, the chief difference between the
French and English work being, that, whereas in French Empire furniture
the excellence of the metal work redeems it from heaviness or ugliness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
such merit was wanting in England, where we have never excelled in
bronze work, the ornament being generally carved in wood, either gilt
or colored bronze-green. When metal was used it was brass, cast and
fairly finished by the chaser, but much more clumsy than the French
work. Therefore, the English furniture of the first years of the nineteenth
century is stiff, massive, and heavy, equally with its French contemporary
wanting in gracefulness, and not having the compensating attractions of
fine mounting, or the originality and individuality which must always add
an interest to Napoleonic furniture.</p>

</div>

<p>There was, however, made about this time by Gillow, to whose
earlier work reference has been made in the previous chapter, some
excellent furniture, which, while to some extent following the fashion of
the day, did so more reasonably. The rosewood and mahogany tables,
chairs, cabinets, and sideboards of his make, inlaid with scrolls and lines
of flat brass, and mounted with handles and feet of brass, generally
representing the heads and claws of lions, do great credit to the English
work of this time. The sofa table and sideboard, illustrated on the
previous page, are of this class, and shew that Sheraton, too, designed
furniture of a less pronounced character, as well as the heavier kind
to which reference has been made.</p>

<p>A very favourable example of the craze in England for classic design
in furniture and decoration, is shewn in the reproduction of a drawing
by Thomas Hope (known as "Anastasius Hope"), in 1807, a well-known
architect of the time, in which it will be observed that the forms and
fashions of some of the chairs and tables described and illustrated in the
chapter on "Ancient Furniture" have been taken as models.</p>

<p>There were several makers of first-class furniture, of whom the names
of some still survive in the "style and title" of firms of the present
day, who are their successors, while those of others have been forgotten,
save by some of our older manufacturers and auctioneers, who, at the
request of the writer, have been good enough to look up old records
and revive the memories of fifty years ago. Of these the best known was
Thomas Seddon, who came from Manchester and settled in Aldersgate
Street. His two sons succeeded to the business, became cabinet makers
to George IV., and furnished and decorated Windsor Castle. At the
King's death their account was disputed, and £30,000 was struck off,
a loss which necessitated an arrangement with their creditors. Shortly
after this, however, they took the Barracks of the London Light Horse
Volunteers in the Gray's Inn Road (now the Hospital), and carried
on there for a time a very extensive business. Seddon's work ranked
with Gillow's, and they shared with that house the best orders for
furniture.</p>

<p>Thomas Seddon, painter of Oriental subjects, who died in 1856, and
P. Seddon, a well-known architect, were grandsons of the original founder
of the firm. On the death of the elder brother, Thomas, the younger
one then transferred his connection to the firm of Johnstone and Jeanes,
in Bond Street, another old house which until recently carried on
business as "Johnstone and Norman," and who some few years ago
executed a very extravagant order for an American millionaire. This was
a reproduction of Byzantine designs in furniture of cedar, ebony, ivory,
and pearl, made from drawings by the late Sir Alma Tadema, R.A.</p>

<p>Snell, of Albemarle Street, was established early in the century, and
had obtained an excellent reputation; his specialité was well-made birch
bedroom suites, but he also made furniture of a general description. The
predecessor of the present firm of Howard and Son, who commenced
business in Whitechapel as early as 1800, and the first Morant, may all
be mentioned as manufacturers in the first quarter of the century.</p>

<p>Somewhat later, Trollopes, of Parliament Street; Holland, who had
succeeded Dowbiggin (Gillow's apprentice), first in Great Pulteney Street,
and subsequently at the firm's present address; Wilkinson, of Ludgate
Hill, founder of the present firm of upholsterers in Bond Street; Aspinwall,
of Grosvenor Street; the second Morant, of whom the great Duke of
Wellington made a personal friend; and Crace, a prominent decorator
of great taste, who carried out many of Pugin's Gothic designs, were all
men of good reputation. Miles and Edwards, of Oxford Street, whom
Hindleys succeeded, were also well known for good middle-class furniture.
These are some of the best known manufacturers of the first half of the
present century, and though until after the Great Exhibition there was,
as a rule, little in the designs to render their productions remarkable, the
work of those named will be found sound in construction, and free from
the faults which accompany the cheap and showy reproductions of more
pretentious styles, which mark so much of the furniture of the present
day. With regard to this, more will be said in the next chapter.</p>

<p>There was then a very limited market for any but the most commonplace
furniture. Our wealthy people bought the productions of French
cabinet makers, either made in Paris or by Frenchmen who came over to
England, and the middle classes were content with the most ordinary and
useful articles. If they had possessed the means, they certainly had neither
the taste nor the education to furnish more ambitiously. The great extent
of suburbs which now surround the Metropolis, and which include such
numbers of expensive and extravagantly-fitted residences of merchants and
tradesmen, did not then exist. The latter lived over their shops or warehouses,
and the former only aspired to a dull house in Bloomsbury, or
like David Copperfield's father-in-law, Mr. Spenlow, a villa at Norwood,
or perhaps a country residence at Hampstead or Highgate.</p>

<p>In 1808 a designer and maker of furniture, George Smith by name,
who held the appointment of "Upholder extraordinary to H.R.H. the
Prince of Wales," and carried on business at "Princess" Street, Cavendish
Square, produced a book of designs, 158 in number, published
by "Wm. Taylor," of Holborn. These include cornices, window drapery,
bedsteads, tables, chairs, bookcases, commodes, and other furniture, the
titles of some of which occur for about the first time in our vocabularies,
having been adapted from the French. "Escritoire, jardinière, dejuné-tables,
chiffoniers" (the spelling copied from Smith's book), all bear the
impress of the pseudo-classic taste; and his designs, some of which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
here reproduced, show the fashion of our so-called artistic furniture in
England at the time of the Regency. Mr. Smith, in the "Preliminary
Remarks" prefacing his illustrations, gives us an idea of the prevailing
taste, which, looking back now some three-quarters of a century, it is
instructive to peruse:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The following practical observations on the various woods employed
in cabinet work may be useful. Mahogany, when used in houses of
consequence, should be confined to the parlour and the bedchamber floors.
In furniture for these apartments the less inlay of other woods, the more
chaste will be the style of work. If the wood be of a fine, compact, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
bright quality, the ornaments may be carved clean in the mahogany.
Where it may be requisite to make out panelling by an inlay of lines, let
those lines be of brass or ebony. In drawing-rooms, boudoirs, ante-rooms,
East and West India satin woods, rosewood, tulip wood, and the other
varieties of woods brought from the East, may be used; with satin and
light coloured woods the decorations may be of ebony or rosewood; with
rosewood let the decorations be <em>ormolu</em>, and the inlay of brass. Bronze
metal, though sometimes used with satin wood, has a cold and poor
effect: it suits better on gilt work, and will answer well enough on
mahogany."</p>

<p>Amongst the designs published by him are some few of a subdued
Gothic character; these are generally carved in light oak, or painted
light stone color, and have, in some cases, heraldic shields, with crests
and coats of arms picked out in color. There are window seats painted
to imitate marble, with the Roman or Greco-Roman ornaments painted
green to represent bronze. The least objectionable are those of mahogany
with bronze green ornaments.</p>

<p>Of the furniture of this period there are several pieces in the Mansion
House, in the City of London, which apparently was partly refurnished
about the commencement of the century.</p>

<p>In the Court Room of the Skinners' Company there are tables which
are now fitted with extensions, so as to form a horseshoe table for
committee meetings. They are good examples of the heavy and solid carving
in mahogany, early in the century before the fashion of representing the
heads and feet of animals in the designs of furniture had gone out. These
tables have massive legs, with lions' heads and claws, carved with great skill
and shewing much spirit, the wood being of the best quality and rich in color.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>


<h3>EARLY VICTORIAN.</h3>

<p>In the work of the manufacturers just enumerated may be traced
the influence of the "Empire" style. With the restoration, however, of
the Monarchy in France, came the inevitable change in fashions, and
"<em xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Le style de l'Empire</em>" was condemned. In its place came a revival of
the Louis Quinze scrolls and curves, but with less character and restraint,
until the style we know as "baroque,"<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> or debased "rococo" came in.
Ornament of a florid and incongruous character was lavished on decorative
furniture, indicative of a taste for display, rather than for appropriate
enrichment.</p>

<p>It had been our English custom for some long period to take our
fashions from France, and, therefore, about the time of William IV. and
during the early part of Queen Victoria's reign, the furniture for our
best houses was designed and made in the French style. In the "Music"
Room at Chatsworth are some chairs and footstools used at the time
of the Coronation of William IV. and Queen Adelaide, which have quite
the appearance of French furniture.</p>

<p>The old fashion of lining rooms with oak panelling, which has been
noticed in the earlier chapter, had undergone a change worth recording.
If the illustration of the Elizabethan oak panelling, as given in the
English section of Chapter III., be referred to, it will be seen that
the oak lining reaches from the floor to within about two or three
feet of the cornice. Subsequently this panelling was divided into an
upper and a lower part, the former commencing about the height of
the back of an ordinary chair, a moulding or chair-rail forming a capping
to the lower part. Then pictures came to be let into the panelling:
and presently the upper part was discarded and the lower wainscoting
remained, properly termed the Dado,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> which we have seen revived both
in wood and in various decorative materials of the present day. During
the period we are now discussing, this arrangement lost favour in the
eyes of our grandfathers, and the lowest member, or base, of the Dado
only was retained, which is now termed the "skirting board."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>As we approach a period that our older contemporaries can
remember, it is very interesting to turn over the leaves of the back
numbers of such magazines and newspapers as treated of the Industrial
Arts. The <em>Art Union</em>, which changed its title to the <cite>Art Journal</cite> in
1849, had then been in existence for about ten years, and had done
good work in promoting the encouragement of Art and manufactures.
The "Society of Arts" had been formed in London as long ago as
1756, and had given prizes for designs and methods of improving different
processes of manufacture. Exhibitions of the specimens sent in for
competition for the awards were, and are still, held at their house in
Adelphi Buildings. Old volumes of "Transactions of the Society" are
quaint works of reference with regard to these exhibitions.</p>

<p>About 1840, Mr., afterwards Sir, Charles Barry, R.A., had designed
and commenced the present, or, as it was then called, the New Palace of
Westminster, and following the Gothic character of the building, the
furniture and fittings were naturally of a design to harmonize with
what was then quite a departure from the heavy architectural taste of
the day. Mr. Barry was the first in the last century to leave the
beaten track, although the Reform and Travellers' Clubs had already been
designed by him on more classic lines. The Speaker's chair in the House
of Commons is evidently designed after one of the fifteenth century
"canopied seats," which have been noticed and illustrated in the second
chapter; and the "linen scroll pattern" panels can be counted by the
thousand in the Houses of Parliament and the different official residences
which form part of the Palace. The character of the work is subdued
and not flamboyant, is excellent in design and workmanship, and is highly
creditable, when we take into consideration the very low state of Art in
England fifty years ago.</p>

<p>This want of taste was very much discussed in the periodicals of the
day, and, yielding to expressed public opinion, Government had in 1840-1
appointed a Select Committee to take into consideration the promotion of
the Fine Arts in the country. Mr. Charles Barry, Mr. Eastlake, and
Sir Martin Shee, R.A., were amongst the witnesses examined. The
report of this Committee, in 1841, contained the opinion "That such an
important and National work as the erection of the two Houses of
Parliament affords an opportunity, which ought not to be neglected, of
encouraging, not only the higher, but every subordinate branch of Fine
Art in this country."</p>

<p>Mr. Augustus Welby Pugin was a well-known designer of the Gothic
style of furniture of this time. Born in 1811, he had published in 1835
his "Designs for Gothic Furniture," and subsequently his "Glossary of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Ecclesiastical Ornament and Costume"; and by skilful application of his
knowledge to the decorations of the different ecclesiastical buildings he
designed, his reputation became established. One of his designs is here
reproduced. Pugin's work and reputation have survived, notwithstanding
the furious opposition he met with at the time. In a review of one of
his books, in the <em>Art Union</em> of 1839, the following sentence completes the
criticism:&mdash;"As it is a common occurrence in life to find genius mistaken
for madness, so does it sometimes happen that a madman is mistaken
for a genius. Mr. Welby Pugin has oftentimes appeared to us to be a
case in point."</p>

</div>

<p>At this time furniture design and manufacture, as an Industrial Art
in England, seems to have attracted no attention whatever. There are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
but few allusions to the design of decorative woodwork in the periodicals
of the day; and the auctioneers' advertisements&mdash;with a few notable
exceptions, like that of the Strawberry Hill Collection of Horace Walpole,
gave no descriptions; no particular interest in the subject appears to
have been manifested, save by a very limited number of the dilettanti,
who, like Walpole, collected the curios and cabinets of two or three
hundred years ago.</p>

</div>

<p>York House was redecorated and furnished about this time, and as it
is described as "Excelling any other dwelling of its own class in regal
magnificence and vieing with the Royal Palaces of Europe," we may take
note of an account of its re-equipment, written in 1841, for the <em>Art
Union</em>. This notice speaks little for the taste of the period, and less for
the knowledge and grasp of the subject by the writer of an Art critique
of the day:&mdash;"The furniture generally is of no particular style, but, on
the whole, there is to be found a mingling of everything, in the best
manner of the best epochs of taste." Writing further on of the ottoman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
couches, "causeses," etc., the critic goes on to tell of an alteration in
fashion which had evidently just taken place: "Some of them, in place
of plain or carved rosewood or mahogany, are ornamented in white
enamel, with classic subjects in bas-relief of perfect execution."</p>

<p>Towards the close of the period embraced in the limits of this
chapter, the eminent firm of Jackson and Graham was making headway.
A French designer named Prignot was of considerable assistance in
establishing their reputation for taste; and in the Exhibition which was
soon to take place this firm took a very prominent position. Collinson
and Lock,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> who afterwards acquired this firm's premises and business, were
both brought up in the house as young men, and left some thirty odd
years ago for Herrings, of Fleet Street, whom they succeeded about 1870.</p>

<p>Another well-known decorator who designed and manufactured furniture
of good quality was Leonard William Collmann, first of Bouverie Street,
and later of George Street, Portman Square. He was a pupil of Sydney
Smirke, R.A. (who designed and built the Carlton and the Conservative
Clubs), and was himself an excellent draughtsman, and carried out the
decoration and furnishing of many public buildings, London Clubs, and
mansions of the nobility and gentry. His son is at present Director of
Decorations to the King at Windsor Castle. Collmann's designs were
occasionally Gothic, but generally classic.</p>

<p>There is evidence of the want of interest in the subject of furniture
in the auctioneers' catalogues of the day. By the courtesy of Messrs.
Christie, Manson and Woods, the writer has had access to the records of
this old firm, and two or three instances of sales of furniture may be given.
While the catalogues of the Picture sales of 1830-40 were printed on
paper of quarto size, and the subjects described at length, those of
"Furniture" are of the old-fashioned small octavo size, resembling the
catalogue of a small country auctioneer of the present day, and the printed
descriptions rarely exceed a single line. The prices seldom amounted
to more than £10; the whole proceeds of the day's sale were often less
than £100, and sometimes did not reach £50. At the sale of "Rosslyn
House," Hampstead, in 1830, a mansion of considerable importance, the
highest-priced article was "A capital mahogany pedestal sideboard, with
hot closet, cellaret, 2 plate drawers, and fluted legs," which brought
£32. At the sale of the property of "A Man of Fashion," "a marqueterie
cabinet, inlaid with trophies, the panels of Sêvres china, mounted in
ormolu," sold for twenty guineas; and a "Reisener (<em>sic</em>) table, beautifully
inlaid with flowers, and drawers," which appears to have been
reserved at nine guineas, was bought in at eight-and-a-half guineas.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
Frequenters of Christie's of the present day who have seen such furniture
realise as many pounds as the shillings included in such sums, will
appreciate the enormously increased value of really good old French
furniture.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most noticeable comparison between the present day and
that of half-a-century ago may be made in reading through the prices
given at the great sale at Stowe House, in 1848, when the financial
difficulties of the Duke of Buckingham caused the sale by auction which
lasted thirty-seven days, and realised upwards of £71,000; the proceeds of
the furniture amounted to £27,152. We have seen in the notice of French
furniture that armoires by Boule have, during the past few years, brought
from £4,000 to £6,000 each, under the hammer, and the want of
appreciation of this work, probably the most artistic ever produced by
designer and craftsman, is sufficiently exemplified by the statement that
at the Stowe sale two of Boule's famous armoires, of similar proportions
to those in the Hamilton Palace and Jones Collections, were sold for £21
and £19 8s. 6d. respectively.</p>

<p>We are accustomed now to see the bids at Christie's advance by
guineas, by fives, tens and fifties; and it is amusing to read in these old
catalogues of marqueterie tables, satin wood cabinets, rosewood pier
tables, and other articles of "ornamental furniture," as it was termed,
being knocked down to Town and Emanuel, Webb, Morant, Hitchcock
Baldock, Forrest, Redfearn, Litchfield (the writer's father), and others
who were the buyers and regular attendants at "Christie's" (afterwards
Christie and Manson) of 1830 to 1845, for such sums as 6s., 15s., and
occasionally £10 or £15.</p>

<p>A single quotation is given, but many such are to be found:&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Sale on February</em> 25<em>th and</em> 26<em>th</em>, 1841. Lot 31. "A small oval
table, with a piece of Sêvres porcelain painted with flowers. 6s."</p>

<p>It is pleasant to remember, as some exception to this general want
of interest in the subject, that in 1843 there was held at Gore House,
Kensington, then the fashionable residence of Lady Blessington, an
exhibition of old furniture; and a series of lectures, illustrated by the
contributions, was given by Mr., now Sir, J. C. Robinson. The Venetian
State chair, illustrated on page <a href="#Page_57">57</a>, was amongst the examples lent by the
Queen on that occasion. Specimens of Boule's work and some good
pieces of Italian Renaissance were also exhibited.</p>

<p>A great many of the older Club Houses of London were built and
furnished between 1813 and 1851, the Guards' being of the earlier date,
and the Army and Navy of the latter; and during the intervening thirty
odd years the United Service, Travellers', Union, United University<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Athenæum, Oriental, Wyndham, Oxford and Cambridge, Reform, Carlton,
Garrick, Conservative, and some others were erected and fitted up. Many
of these still retain much of the furniture of Gillows, Seddons, and some
of the other manufacturers of the time whose work has been alluded to,
and these are favourable examples of the best kind of cabinet work done
in England during the reign of George IV., William IV., and that of the
early part of Queen Victoria. It is worth recording, too, that during
this period, steam power, which had been first applied to machinery about
1815, came into more general use in the manufacture of furniture. With
its adoption there seems to have been a gradual abandonment of the
apprenticeship system in the factories and workshops of our country;
and the present "piece-work" arrangement, which had obtained more or
less since the English cabinet makers had brought out their "Book of
Prices" some years previously, became generally the custom of the trade,
in place of the older "day work" of a former generation.</p>

<p>In France the success of national exhibitions had become assured, the
exhibitors having increased from only 110, when the first experiment was
tried in 1798, by leaps and bounds, until at the eleventh exhibition, in
1849, there were 4,494 entries. The <em>Art Journal</em> of that year gives us
a good illustrated notice of some of the exhibits, and devotes an article
to pointing out the advantages to be gained by something of the kind
taking place in England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>From 1827 onwards we had established local exhibitions in Dublin,
Leeds, and Manchester. The first time a special building was devoted to
the exhibition of manufactures was at Birmingham in 1849; and from the
illustrated review of this in the <em>Art Journal</em>, one can see that there was
a desire on the part of our designers and manufacturers to strike out
in new directions and make progress.</p>

<p>We are able to reproduce some of the designs of furniture of this
period; and in the cradle designed and carved in Turkey-boxwood, for
Queen Victoria, by Mr. Harry Rogers, we have a fine piece of work, which
would not have disgraced the latter period of the Renaissance. Indeed,
Mr. Rogers was a very notable designer and carver of this time; he had
introduced his famous boxwood carving about seven years previously.</p>

<p>This cradle was also, by Queen Victoria's command, sent to the
Exhibition, and it may be worth while quoting the artist's description of
the carving:&mdash;"In making the design for the cradle it was my intention
that the entire object should symbolize the union of the Royal Houses of
England with that of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and with this view, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
arranged that one end should exhibit the arms and national motto of
England, and the other those of H.R.H. Prince Albert. The inscription,
'Anno, 1850,' was placed between the dolphins by Her Majesty's special
command."</p>

<p>In a criticism of this excellent specimen of work, the <em>Art Journal</em> of
the time said:&mdash;"We believe the cradle to be one of the most important
examples of the art of wood carving ever executed in this country."</p>

<p>Rogers was also a writer of considerable ability on the styles of
ornament: and there are several contributions from his pen to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
periodicals of the day, besides designs which were published in the
<em>Art Journal</em> under the heading of "Original Designs for Manufacturers."
These articles appeared occasionally, and contained many excellent suggestions
for manufacturers and carvers, amongst others the drawings of
H. Fitzcook, one of whose designs for a work table is here reproduced.
Others more or less constant contributors of the original designs for furniture
were J. Strudwick and W. Holmes, a design from the pencil of each of
whom is given.</p>

</div>

<p>But though here and there in England good designers came to the
front, as a general rule the art of design in furniture and decorative
woodwork was at a very low ebb about this time.</p>

<p>In furniture, straight lines and simple curves may be plain and
uninteresting, but they are by no means so objectionable as the over
ornamentation of the debased rococo style, which obtained in this country
about forty years ago; and if the scrolls and flowers, the shells and
rockwork which ornamented mirror frames, sideboard backs, sofas, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
chairs, were debased in style, even when carefully carved in wood, the
effect was infinitely worse when, for the sake of economy, as was the
case with the houses of the middle classes, this elaborate and laboured
enrichment was executed in the fashionable stucco of the day.</p>

<p>Large mirrors, with gilt frames of this material, held the places of
honor on the marble chimney piece, and on the console, or pier table,
which was also of gilt stucco, with a marble slab. The chiffonier, with
its shelves having scroll supports like an elaborate S, and a mirror at the
back, with a scrolled frame, was a favourite article of furniture.</p>

<p>Carpets were badly designed, and loud and vulgar in coloring;
chairs, on account of the shape and ornament in vogue, were unfitted
for their purpose, on account of the wood being cut across the grain;
the fire-screen, in a carved rosewood frame, contained the caricature, in
needlework, of a spaniel, or a family group of the time, ugly enough to
be in keeping with its surroundings.</p>

<p>The dining room was sombre and heavy. The pedestal sideboard,
with a large mirror with a scrolled frame at the back, had come in; the
chairs were massive and ugly survivals of the earlier reproductions of the
Greek patterns, and though solid and substantial, the effect was neither
cheering nor refining.</p>

<p>In the bedrooms were winged wardrobes and chests of drawers;
dressing tables and washstands, with scrolled legs, nearly always in
mahogany; the old four-poster had given way to the Arabian or French
bedstead, and this was being gradually replaced by the iron or brass
bedsteads, which came in after the "Exhibition of 1851" had shewn
people the advantages of the lightness and cleanliness of these materials.</p>

<p>In a word, from the early part of the last century, until the
impetus given to Art by this great Exhibition had had time to take effect,
the general taste in furnishing houses of all but a very few persons was
at about its worst.</p>

<p>In other countries the rococo taste had also taken hold. France
maintained a higher standard than England, and such figure work as was
introduced into her furniture, was better executed, though her joinery was
inferior. In Italy, old models of the Renaissance still served as examples
for reproduction, but the ornament was more carelessly carved and the
decoration less considered. Ivory inlaying was largely practised in Milan
and Venice; mosaics of marble were <em>specialités</em> of Rome and of Florence,
and were much used in the decoration of cabinets; Venice was busy
manufacturing carved walnutwood furniture, in buffets, cabinets, negro
page boys elaborately painted and gilt; and carved mirror frames, the
chief ornaments of which were cupids and foliage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>Italian carving has always been free and spirited, the figures have
never been wanting in grace, and though by comparison with the best
time of the Renaissance there is a great falling off, still, the work executed
in Italy during the nineteenth century has been of considerable merit as
regards ornament, though this has been overdone. In construction, and
joinery, however, the Italian work was and still is, for the most part, very
inferior. Cabinets of great pretension and elaborate ornament, inlaid
perhaps with ivory, lapislazuli, or marbles, are so imperfectly made that
one would think ornament, and certainly not durability, had been the
object of the producer.</p>

<p>In Antwerp, Brussels, Liege, and other Flemish Art centres, the
School of Wood Carving, which came in with the Renaissance, appears
to have been maintained with more or less excellence. With the
increased quality of the carved woodwork manufactured, there was a
proportion of ill-finished and over-ornamented work produced; and although,
as has been before observed, the manufacture of cheap marqueterie in
Amsterdam, and other Dutch cities was bringing the name of Dutch
furniture into ill-repute&mdash;still, so far as the writer's observations have
gone, the Flemish wood-carver appears to have been, at the time now
under consideration, ahead of his fellow craftsmen in Europe; and when,
in the ensuing chapter, we shall notice some of the representative
exhibits in the great International Competition of 1851, it will be seen
that the Antwerp designer and carver was certainly in the foremost rank.</p>

<p>In Austria, too, some good cabinet work was being carried out,
M. Leistler, of Vienna, having at the time a high reputation.</p>

<p>In Paris, the house of Fourdinois was making a name which, in
subsequent exhibitions, we shall see took a leading place among the
designers and manufacturers of decorative furniture.</p>

<p>England, it has been observed, was suffering from languor in Art
industry. The excellent designs of the Adams and their school, which
obtained early in the century, had been supplanted, and a meaningless
rococo style succeeded the heavy imitations of French pseudo-classic
furniture. Instead of, as in the earlier and more tasteful periods, when
architects had designed woodwork and furniture to accord with the style
of their buildings, they appear to have then, as a general rule, abandoned
the control of the decoration of interiors, and the result was one which&mdash;when
we examine our National furniture of half a century ago&mdash;has not
left us much to be proud of as an artistic and industrious people.</p>

<p>Some notice has been taken of the appreciation of this unsatisfactory
state of things by the Government of the time, and by the Press; and,
as with a knowledge of our deficiency, came the desire and the energy to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
bring about its remedy, we shall see that, with the Exhibition of 1851,
and the intercourse and the desire to improve, which naturally followed
that great and successful effort, our designers and craftsmen profited by
the great stimulus which Art and Industry then received.</p>

<p><span class="figleft100"><img src="images/i_229d.jpg" width="160" height="300" alt="I" />&nbsp;</span>N the previous chapter, attention has been taken
of the success of the National Exhibition in Paris
of 1849; in the same year the competition of our
manufacturers at Birmingham gave an impetus
to Industrial Art in England, and there was about
this time a general forward movement, with a
desire for an International Exhibition on a grand
scale. Articles advocating such a step appeared
in newspapers and periodicals of the time, and,
after much difficulty, and many delays, a committee
for the promotion of this object was formed.
This resulted in the appointment of a Royal Commission,
and the Prince Consort, as President of
this Commission, took a keen personal interest
in every arrangement for this great enterprise.
Indeed, there can be no doubt that the success
which crowned the work was, in a great measure, due to his taste,
patience, and excellent business capacity. It is no part of our task to
record all the details of an undertaking which, at the time, was a
burning question of the day; still, as we cannot but look upon this
Exhibition of 1851 as one of the landmarks in the history of furniture,
it is worth while to record some particulars of its genesis and accomplishment.</p>

<p>The idea of the Exhibition of 1851 is said to have been originally
due to Mr. F. Whishaw, Secretary of the Society of Arts, as early as
1844, but no active steps were taken until 1849, when the Prince Consort,
who was President of the Society, took the matter up very warmly. His
speech at one of the meetings contained the following sentence:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now is the time to prepare for a great Exhibition&mdash;an Exhibition
worthy of the greatness of this country, not merely national in its scope
and benefits, but comprehensive of the whole world; and I offer myself
to the public as their leader, if they are willing to assist in the undertaking."</p>

1851 Exhibition, London.</p></div>
</div>

<p>To Mr. (afterwards Sir) Joseph Paxton, then head gardener to the
Duke of Devonshire, the general idea of the famous glass and iron building
is due. An enterprising firm of contractors, Messrs. Fox and Henderson,
were entrusted with the work; a guarantee fund of some £230,000 was
raised by public subscriptions; and the great Exhibition was opened by
Queen Victoria on the 1st of May, 1851. At a civic banquet in honor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
the event, the Prince Consort very aptly described the object of the great
experiment:&mdash;"The Exhibition of 1851 would afford a true test of the
point of development at which the whole of mankind had arrived in this
great task, and a new starting point from which all nations would be
able to direct their further exertions."</p>

<p>The number of exhibitors was some 17,000, of whom over 3,000
received prize and council medals; and the official catalogue, compiled by
Mr. Scott Russell, the secretary, contains a great many particulars which
are instructive reading, when we compare the work of many of the firms
of manufacturers, whose exhibits are therein described, with their work of
the present day.</p>

<p>The <em>Art Journal</em> published a special volume, entitled "The Art
Journal Illustrated Catalogue," with woodcuts of the more important
exhibits, and, by the courtesy of the proprietors, a small selection is
reproduced, which will give the reader an idea of the design of furniture,
both in England and the chief Continental industrial centres at that time.</p>

<p>They have been selected as being fairly representative of the work of
the time, and not on account of their own intrinsic excellence.</p>

<p>With regard to the exhibits of English firms, of which these illustrations
include examples, little requires to be said, in addition to the
remarks already made in the preceding chapter, of their work previous
to the Exhibition. One of the illustrations, however, may in passing be
further alluded to, since the changes in form and character of the
Pianoforte is of some importance in the consideration of the design of
furniture. Messrs. Broadwood's Grand Pianoforte (illustrated) was a rich
example of decorative woodwork in ebony and gold, and may be compared
with the illustration on page <a href="#Page_172">172</a> of a harpsichord, which the Piano had
replaced about 1767; and this supplies evidence of the increased attention
devoted to decorative furniture at and since the time of the 1851
Exhibition. In the Appendix will be found a short notice of the different
phases through which the ever-present piano has passed, from the virginal,
or spinette&mdash;of which an illustration will be found in "A Sixteenth
Century Room" in Chapter III.&mdash;down to the latest development of the
decoration of the case of the instrument by leading artists of the present
day. Mr. Algernon Rose, of Messrs. Broadwood, whose firm was
established at their present address in 1732, has been good enough to
supply the author with the particulars for this notice.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the illustrations of these exhibits that, so far as
figure carving and composition are concerned, our foreign rivals, the
Italians, Belgians, Austrians, and French, were far ahead of us. In mere
construction and excellence of work, we have ever been able to hold our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
own, and, so long as our designers have kept to beaten tracks, the effect
is satisfactory. It is only when an attempt has been made to soar above
the conventional, that the effort is not so successful.</p>

<p>In Papier-maché. 1851 Exhibition, London.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In looking over the list of exhibits, one finds evidence of the
fickleness of fashions. The manufacture of decorative articles of furniture
of <em>papier-maché</em> was then very extensive, and there are several specimens
of this class of work executed, both by French and English firms. The
drawing-room of 1850 to 1860 was apparently incomplete without
occasional chairs, a screen with painted panel, a work table, or some
small cabinet or casket of this decorative but somewhat flimsy material.</p>

<p>The design and execution of mountings of cabinets in metal work,
particularly of the highly-chased and gilt bronzes for the enrichment of
<em>meubles de luxe</em>, was then, as it still to a great extent remains, the
<em>specialité</em> of the Parisian craftsman, and almost the only English exhibits
of such work were those of foreigners who had settled amongst us.</p>

<p>Amongst the latter was Monbro, a Frenchman, who established himself
in Berners Street, London, and made furniture of an ornamental character
in the style of his countrymen, reproducing the older designs of "Boule"
and marqueterie furniture. The present house of Mellier and Cie. are his
successors, Mellier having been in his employ. The late Samson Wertheimer,
father of Messrs. Charles and Asher Wertheimer, now so well known in the
Art world, then in Greek Street, Soho, was steadily making a reputation
by the excellence of the metal mountings of his own design and workmanship,
which he applied to caskets of French style. Furniture of a
decorative character and of excellent quality was also made some forty
years ago by Town and Emanuel, of Bond Street, and many of this firm's
"Old French" tables and cabinets were so carefully finished with regard
to style and detail, that, with the "tone" which time has given them,
it is not always easy to distinguish them from the models from which
they were taken. Toms was assistant to Town and Emanuel, and afterwards
purchased and carried on the business of "Toms and Luscombe,"
a firm well known as manufacturers of excellent and expensive "French"
furniture, until their retirement from business over twenty years ago.</p>

1862 Exhibition.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The next International Exhibition held in London was in the year
1862, and, though its success was somewhat impaired by the great
calamity this country sustained in the death of the Prince Consort on
14th December, 1861, and also by the breaking out of the Civil War in the
United States of America, the exhibitors had increased from 17,000 in '51
to some 29,000 in '62, the foreign entries being 16,456, as against 6,566.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>Exhibitions of a National and International character had also been
held in many of the Continental capitals. There was in 1855 a successful
one in Paris, which was followed by one still greater in 1867, and, as
every one knows, they have been lately of almost annual occurrence in
various countries, affording the enterprising manufacturer better and more
frequent opportunities of placing his productions before the public, and
of teaching both producer and consumer to appreciate and profit by every
improvement in taste, and by the greater demand for artistic objects.</p>

<p>The few illustrations from these more recent Exhibitions of 1862
and 1867 deserve a passing notice. The cabinet of carved ebony with
enrichments of carnelion and other richly-colored minerals (illustrated on
previous page), was made by the firm in which the author's father was senior
partner; it received a good deal of notice, and was purchased by William,
third Earl of Craven, a well-known virtuoso of some forty years ago.</p>

<p>The work of Fourdinois, of Paris, has already been alluded to, and
in the 1867 Exhibition his furniture acquired a still higher reputation for
good taste and attention to detail. The full page illustration of a cabinet
of ebony, with carvings of boxwood, represents a remarkably rich piece of
work of its kind; the effect is produced by carving the boxwood figures
and ornamental scroll work in separate pieces, and then inserting these
bodily into the ebony. By this means the more intricate work is able to
be more carefully executed, and the close grain and rich tint of Turkey
boxwood (perhaps next to ivory the best medium for rendering fine carving)
tells out in relief against the ebony of which the body of the cabinet is
constructed. This excellent example of modern cabinet work by Fourdinois
was purchased for the South Kensington Museum for £1,200,
and no one who has a knowledge of the cost of executing minute carved
work in boxwood and ebony, will consider the price excessive.</p>

<p>The house of Fourdinois no longer exists; the names of the foremost
makers of French <em>meubles de luxe</em>, in Paris, of this time were Beurdely,
Dasson, Roux, Sormani, Durand, and Zwiener. Some mention has already
been made of Zwiener, as the maker of a famous bureau in the Hertford
Collection,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and a sideboard exhibited by Durand in the '51 Exhibition is
amongst the illustrations selected as representative of cabinet work at that time.</p>

<p>The illustration of Wright and Mansfield's satinwood cabinet, with
Wedgwood plaques inserted, and with wreaths and swags of marqueterie
inlaid, is in the Adams style, a class of design of which this firm
made a <em>specialité</em>. Both Wright and Mansfield had been assistants
at Jackson and Graham's, and after a short term in Great Portland
Street, they removed to Bond Street, and carried on a successful
business of a high class and somewhat exclusive character, until their
retirement some years ago. This cabinet was exhibited in Paris in
1867, and was purchased by our South Kensington authorities. Perhaps
it is not generally known that a grant is made to the Department for the
purchase of suitable specimens of furniture and woodwork for the Museum.
This expenditure is made with great care and discrimination. It may be
observed here that the South Kensington Museum, which was founded in
1851, was, at the time of which we are writing, playing an important
part in the Art education of the country. The literature of the day
also contributed many useful works of instruction and reference for the
designer of furniture and woodwork.</p>

<p>The work of Mr. Bruce J. Talbert deserves mention here, and should
not have been omitted in the first edition. His designs for furniture,
conceived on the basis of modified Gothic, adapted to modern requirements,
were appreciated by a considerable following; and the dining room
and library furniture especially, made from his drawings, stand the test of
time. He published a book of designs in 1868, entitled "Gothic Forms
applied to Furniture, Metal Work, and Decoration for Domestic Purposes,"
and, subsequently, in 1876, "Examples of Ancient and Modern Furniture,
Tapestries, Metal Work, Decoration, &amp;c." In this latter work he reproduced
several of his drawings, which had been exhibited in the Royal
Academy in 1870 and five following years; and he compiled a reference
table of the dates when the various periods of architecture came in,
with marginal notes, which will be found very useful to the reader in
connection with our subject. We have, by permission of Mr. Talbert's
publisher (Mr. Batsford, of Holborn), been able to give here a full-page
illustration of part of a design for a dining room, from his Academy
drawing of 1870, which will convey a fair idea of the character of his
work. Talbert made designs for furniture exhibited in Paris in 1867,
one of which, that of a Sideboard, made by Gillows, was purchased for
the South Kensington Museum. Shortly before his death he turned his
attention to Renaissance designs.</p>

<p>One noticeable feature of modern design in furniture, is the revival
of marquetry. Like all mosaic work, to which branch of Industrial Art
it properly belongs, this kind of decoration should be quite subordinate
to the general design; but, with a rage for novelty which seized public
attention some forty years ago, it developed into the production of all
kinds of fantastic patterns in different veneers. A kind of minute mosaic
work in wood, which was called "Tunbridge Wells work," became
fashionable for small articles. Within the last twenty-five years, the
reproductions of what is termed "Chippendale," and also of Adam, and
Sheraton, designs in marqueterie furniture, have been manufactured to
an enormous extent. Partly on account of the difficulty in obtaining the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
richly-marked and figured old mahogany and satin-wood, of a hundred years
ago, which needed little or no inlay as ornament, and partly to meet the
public fancy, by covering up bad construction with veneers of marquetry
decoration, a great deal more inlay has been given to these reproductions
than ever appeared in the original work of the eighteenth century cabinet
makers. Simplicity was sacrificed, and veneers, thus used and abused,
came to be a term of contempt, implying sham or superficial ornament.
Dickens, in one of his novels, has introduced the "Veneer" family, thus
stamping the term more strongly on the popular imagination.</p>

<p>The method now practised in using marquetry to decorate furniture
is very similar to the one explained in the description of "Boule" furniture
given in Chapter VI., except that instead of shell, the marquetry cutter
uses the veneer, which he intends to be the groundwork of his design, and
as in some cases these veneers are cut to the thickness of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> of an inch,
several layers can be sawn through at once. Sometimes, instead of using
so many different kinds of wood, when a polychromatic effect is required,
holly wood and sycamore are stained different colors, and the marquetry
thus prepared, is glued on to the body of the furniture, and subsequently
prepared, engraved, and polished.</p>

<p>This kind of work is done to a great extent in England, but still
more extensively and elaborately in France and Italy, where ivory and
brass, marble, and other materials are also used to enrich the effect.
This effect is either satisfactory or the reverse, according as the work is
well or ill-considered and executed.</p>

<p>It must be obvious, too, that in the production of marquetry the
processes are obtainable by machinery, which saves labour and cheapens
productions of the commoner kinds; this tends to produce a decorative
effect which is often inappropriate and superabundant.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is allowable to add here that marquetry, or <em>marqueterie</em>, its
French equivalent, is the more modern survival of "Tarsia" work, to
which allusion has been made in previous chapters. Webster defines
the word as "Work inlaid with pieces of wood, shells, ivory, and the
like," derived from the French word <em>marqueter</em>, to checker, and <em>marque</em> (a
sign), of German origin. It is distinguished from parquetry (which is
derived from "<em>parc</em>," an enclosure, of which it is a diminutive), and
signifies a kind of joinery in geometrical patterns, generally used for
flooring. When, however, the marquetry assumes geometrical patterns
(frequently a number of cubes shaded in perspective), the design is often
termed in Art catalogues a "parquetry" design.</p>

<p>In considering the design and manufacture of furniture of the present
day, as compared with that of, say, a hundred years ago, there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
two or three main factors to be taken into account. Of these the most
important is the enormously increased demand, by the multiplication of
purchasers, for some classes of furniture, which formerly had but a
limited sale. This enables machinery to be used to advantage in
economising labour, and therefore one finds in the so-called "Queen Anne"
and "Jacobean" cabinet work of the well-furnished house of the present
time, rather too prominent evidence of the lathe and the steam plane.
Mouldings are machined by the length, then cut into cornices, mitred
round panels, or affixed to the edge of a plain slab of wood, giving
it the effect of carving. The everlasting spindle, turning rapidly by the
lathe, is introduced with wearisome redundance, to ornament the
stretcher and the edge of a shelf; the busy fret or band-saw produces
fanciful patterns which form a cheap enrichment when applied to a
drawer-front, a panel, or a frieze; and carving machines can copy any
design, which a century ago were the careful and painstaking result of
a practised craftsman's skill.</p>

<p>Again, as the manufacture of furniture is now chiefly carried on in
large factories, both in England and on the Continent, the sub-division
of labour causes the article to pass through different hands, in successive
stages, and the wholesale manufacture of furniture by steam, has taken
the place of the personal supervision by the master's eye, of the task
of the few men who were in the old days the occupants of his workshop.
As a writer on the subject has well said, "the chisel and the knife are no
longer in such cases controlled by the sensitive touch of the human hand."
In connection with this we are reminded of Ruskin's precept that "the
first condition of a work of Art is that it should be conceived and carried
out by one person."</p>

<p>Instead of the carved ornament being the outcome of the artist's
educated taste, which places on the article the stamp of individuality&mdash;instead
of the furniture being, as it was in the seventeenth century in
England, and some hundred years earlier in Italy and in France, the
craftsman's pride&mdash;it is now the result of the rapid multiplication of some
pattern which had caught the popular fancy, generally a design in which
there is a good deal of decorative effect, for a comparatively small price.</p>

<p>The difficulty of altering this unsatisfactory state of things is evident.
On the one side, the manufacturers or the large furnishing firms have a
strong case in their contention, that the public will go to the market
it considers the best: and when decoration is pitted against simplicity,
though the construction which accompanies the former be ever so faulty,
the more pretentious article will be selected. When a successful pattern
has been produced, and arrangements and sub-contracts have been made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
for its repetition in large quantities, any considerable variation made in
the details (even if it be the suppression of ornament) will cause an
addition to the cost which those only who understand something of a
manufacturer's business can appreciate.</p>

<p>During the present generation an Art movement has sprung up called
Æstheticism, which has been defined as the "Science of the Beautiful
and the Philosophy of the Fine Arts," and aims at carrying a love of the
beautiful into all the relations of life. The fantastical developments which
accompanied the movement brought its devotees into much ridicule about
twenty years ago, and the pages of <em>Punch</em> of that time will be found to
happily travesty its more amusing and extravagant aspects. The great
success of Gilbert and Sullivan's operetta, "Patience," produced in 1881,
was also to some extent due to the humorous allusions to the
extravagance of the "Æsthetes." In support of what may be termed a
higher Æstheticism, Mr. Ruskin has written much to give expression to
his ideas and principles for rendering our surroundings more beautiful. The
names of the late Sir Frederic Leighton and of Sir Alma Tadema are
conspicuous amongst those who have in their houses carried such principles
into effect, and among others who have been and are, more or less,
associated with this movement, may be named Rossetti, Burne Jones,
Holman Hunt, and William Morris. As a writer on Æstheticism has
observed:&mdash;"When the extravagances attending the movement have been
purged away, there may be still left an educating influence, which will impress
the lofty and undying principles of Art upon the minds of the people."</p>

<p>For a time, in spite of ridicule, this so-called Æstheticism was the
vogue, and considerably affected the design and decoration of furniture
of the time. Woodwork was painted olive green; the panels of cabinets,
painted in sombre colors, had pictures of sad-looking maidens, and
there was an attempt at a "dim religious" effect in our rooms, quite
inappropriate to such a climate as that of England. The reaction,
however, from the garish and ill-considered colorings of a previous decade
or two, has left behind it much good, and with the catholicity of taste
which marks the furniture of the present day, people see some merit
in every style, and are endeavouring to select that which is desirable
without running to the extreme of eccentricity.</p>

<p>Perhaps the advantage thus gained is counterbalanced by the loss
of our old "traditions," for amongst the wilderness of reproductions
of French furniture, more or less frivolous&mdash;of Chippendale, as that
master is generally understood&mdash;of what is termed "Jacobean" and
"Queen Anne"&mdash;to say nothing of a quantity of so-called "antique
furniture," we are bewildered in attempting to identify the latter end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
of the nineteenth century with any particular style of furniture. By
"tradition" it is intended to allude to the old-fashioned manner of handing
down from father to son, or master to apprentice, for successive generations,
the knowledge and skill to produce any particular class of object of Art
or manufacture. Surely Ruskin had something of this in his mind when
he said, "Now, when the powers of fancy, stimulated by this triumphant
precision of manual dexterity, descend from generation to generation, you
have at last what is not so much a trained artist, as a new species of
animal, with whose instinctive gifts you have no chance of contending."</p>

<p>Tradition may be said to still survive in the country cartwright,
who produces the farmer's wagon in accordance with custom and
tradition, modifying the method of construction somewhat perhaps to
meet altered conditions of circumstances, and then ornamenting his work
by no particular set design or rule, but partly from inherited aptitude
and partly from playfulness or fancy. In the house-carpenter attached
to some of our old English family estates, there will also be found, here
and there, surviving representatives of the traditional "joyner" of the
seventeenth century; and in Eastern countries, particularly in Japan, we
find the dexterous joiner or carver of to-day is a descendant of a long
line of more or less excellent mechanics.</p>

<p>It must be obvious, too, that "Trade Unionism" of the present
day cannot but be, in many of its effects, prejudicial to the industrial
Arts. A movement which aims at reducing men of different intelligence
and ability to a common standard, and which controls the amount of
work done, and the price paid for it, whatever are its social or economical
advantages, must have a deleterious influence upon the Art products of
our time.</p>

<p>Writers on Art and manufactures, of varying eminence and opinion,
are unanimous in pointing out the serious drawbacks to progress which will
exist, so long as there is a demand for cheap and meretricious imitations
of old furniture, as opposed to more simply made articles, designed in
accordance with the purposes for which they are intended. Within the
past few years a great many well directed endeavours have been made
in England to improve design in furniture, and to revive something of
the feeling of pride and ambition in his craft, which, in the old days
of the Trade Guilds, animated our Jacobean joiner. One of the best
directed of these enterprises is that of the "Arts and Crafts Exhibition
Society," of which Mr. Walter Crane, A.R.W.S., is president, and which
includes, in its committee and supporters, a great many influential names.
As suggested on the "cover" of their Exhibition Catalogue, designed by
the President, one chief aim of the Society is to link arm and arm "Design<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
and Handicraft," by exhibiting only such articles as bear the names of
individuals who, respectively, drew the design and carried it out: each
craftsman has thus the credit and responsibility of his own part of the
work, instead of the whole appearing as the production of Messrs. A. B.
or C. D., who may have known nothing personally of the matter beyond
generally directing the affairs of a large manufacturing or furnishing
business.</p>

<p>In the catalogue published by this Society there are several short
and useful essays in which furniture is treated, generally and specifically,
by capable writers, amongst whom are Mr. Walter Crane, Mr. Edward
Prior, Mr. Halsey Ricardo, Mr. Reginald T. Blomfield, Mr. W. R.
Letharby, Mr. J. H. Pollen, Mr. Stephen Webb, and Mr. T. G. Jackson,
R.A., the order of names being that in which the several essays are
arranged. This small but valuable contribution to the subject of design
and manufacture of furniture, is full of interest, and points out the defects of
our present system. Amongst other regrets, one of the writers (Mr. Halsey
Ricardo) complains that the "transient tenure that most of us have in our
dwellings, and the absorbing nature of the struggle that most of us have
to make to win the necessary provisions of life, prevent our encouraging
the manufacture of well wrought furniture. We mean to outgrow our
houses&mdash;our lease expires after so many years, and then we shall want
an entirely different class of furniture&mdash;consequently we purchase articles
that have only sufficient life in them to last the brief period of our
occupation, and are content to abide by the want of appropriateness or
beauty, in the clear intention of some day surrounding ourselves with
objects that shall be joys to us for the remainder of our life."</p>

<p>The School of Art Woodcarving at South Kensington, which was
established some twenty years ago at "the City and Guilds Institute," is
also doing a useful and practical work. With a very moderate grant from
the City Guilds and the use of free quarters, the School maintains
itself, and is the means of educating, either free or at reduced terms, a
great many students who go out into the world the better prepared
to compete with their foreign rivals. The Committee of Management,
under the presidency of Major-General Sir J. F. D. Donelly, K.C.B., is
composed of artists and architects of note and others who not only give
their moral support to the institution but bring some of their ornamental
woodwork to the School for execution under their direction.</p>

<p>The management of Miss Rowe<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> is evidence of the success which
attends the effort of an intelligent and enthusiastic lady, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
instructors, Messrs. Grimwood and Ross, are practical carvers, who can
not only correct but can design and cut the patterns set for their pupils.
After the first year probation the professional students receive a fair
proportion of the value of their work, which is assessed by the instructors.</p>

<p>It is by the maintenance of such technical schools, which with more
or less success are now being started by our local authorities in different
parts of England, that we can to some extent replace the advantages
which the old system of apprenticeship gave to the learners of a craft.</p>

<p>In the collection of the late Lady Marian Alford.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Many other societies, guilds, and Art schools have been established
with more or less success, with a view of improving the design and
manufacture of furniture, and providing suitable models for our young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
woodcarvers to copy. The Ellesmere Cabinet (illustrated on page <a href="#Page_243">243</a>) was
one of the productions of the "Home Arts and Industries Association,"
founded in 1883 by the late Lady Marian Alford, a well known connoisseur
and Art patron. It will be seen that this is virtually a Jacobean design.</p>

<p>In the earlier chapters of this book, it has been observed that
as Architecture became a settled Art or Science, it was accompanied by
a corresponding development in the design of the room and its furniture,
under, as it were, one impulse of design, and this appropriate concord may
be said to have obtained in England until nearly the middle of the last
century, when, after the artificial Greek style in furniture and woodwork
which had been attempted by Wilkins, Soane, and other contemporary
architects, had fallen into disfavour, there was first a reaction, and then
an interregnum, as has been noticed in the previous chapter. The
Great Exhibition marked a fresh departure, and quickened, as we
have seen, industrial enterprise in this country: and though, upon the
whole, good results have been produced by the impetus given by
these international competitions, they have not been exempt from
unfavourable accompaniments. One of these was the eager desire for
novelty, without the necessary judgment to discriminate between good and
bad. For a time, nothing satisfied the purchaser of so-called "artistic"
products, whether of decorative furniture, carpets, curtains, or merely
ornamental articles, unless the design was "new." The natural result
was the production either of heavy, or ugly, or flimsy and inappropriate
furniture, which has been condemned by every competent writer on
the subject. In some of the designs selected from the exhibits of '51
this desire to leave the beaten track of conventionality will be evident;
and for a considerable time after the Exhibition, we can see, in our
designs, the result of too many opportunities for imitation, acting upon
minds insufficiently trained to exercise careful judgment and selection.</p>

<p>About the early part of the nineteenth century, the custom of employing
architects to design the interior fittings and the furniture of their
buildings, so as to harmonize, appears to have been abandoned; this was
probably due, partly to some indifference to this subsidiary portion of their
work, but also to the change of taste which led people to prefer the
cheapness of painted and artificially grained pine-wood, with decorative
effects produced by wall-papers, to the more solid but expensive though
less showy wood-panelling, architectural mouldings, well-made panelled
doors and chimney pieces, which one finds, down to quite the end of the
previous century, even in houses of moderate rentals. Furniture therefore
became independent, and, "beginning to account herself an Art, trangressed
her limits" ... and "grew to the conceit that it could stand by itself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
and, as well as its betters, went a way of its own."<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> The effect of this
is to be seen in "interiors" of our own time which are handed over from
the builder, as it were, in blank, to be filled up from the upholsterer's
store, the curiosity shop, and the auction room, while a large contribution
from the conservatory or the nearest florist, gives a finishing touch to a
mixture, which characterises the present taste for furnishing a boudoir or
a drawing room.</p>

<p>(<em>From a Photo by Bedford Lemére &amp; Co., by permission of H.M. The King.</em>)</p></div>
</div>

<p>There is, of course, in very many cases, an individuality gained by
the "omnium gatherum" of such a mode of furnishing. The cabinet which
reminds its owner of a tour in Italy, the quaint stool from Tangier, and
the embroidered piano-cover from Spain, are to those who are in the
habit of travelling, pleasant souvenirs; as are also the presents from
friends (when they have taste and judgment), the screens and flower-stands
and the photographs, which are reminiscences of the forms and faces
separated from us by distance or removed by death. The test of the
whole question of such an arrangement of furniture in our living rooms,
is the amount of judgment and discretion displayed. Two favourable
examples of the present fashion, representing the interior of the Saloon
and Drawing Room at Sandringham House, are here reproduced.</p>

<p>There is at the present time an ambition on the part of many
well-to-do persons to imitate the effect produced in houses of old families,
where, for generations, valuable and memorable articles of decorative
furniture have been accumulated, just as pictures, plate and china have
been preserved; and failing the inheritance of such household gods, it is
the practice to acquire, or as the modern term goes, "to collect," old
furniture of different styles and periods, until the room becomes incongruous
and overcrowded, an evidence of the wealth, rather than of the taste, of
the owner. As it frequently happens that such collections are made very
hastily, and in the brief intervals of a busy commercial or political
life, the selections are not the best or most suitable; and where so
much is required in a short space of time, it becomes impossible to
devote a sufficient sum of money to procure really valuable specimens;
in their place, effective and low-priced reproductions of an old pattern
(with all the faults inseparable from such conditions) are added to the
conglomeration of articles requiring attention, and taking up space. The
limited accommodation of houses built on ground which is too valuable to
allow spacious halls and large apartments, makes this want of discretion
and judgment the more objectionable. There can be no doubt that want
of care and restraint in the selection of furniture, by the purchasing
public, affects its character, both as to design and workmanship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>These are some of the faults in the modern style of furnishing,
which have been pointed out by recent writers and lecturers on the
subject. In "Hints on Household Taste,"<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Mr. Eastlake has scolded us
severely for running after novelties and fashions, instead of cultivating
suitability and simplicity, in the selection and ordering of our furniture;
and he has contrasted descriptions and drawings of well designed and
constructed pieces of furniture of the Jacobean period with those of last
century's productions. Col. Robert Edis, in "Decoration and Furniture
of Town Houses," has published designs which are both simple and
economical, with regard to space and money, while suitable to the specified
purpose of the furniture or "fitment."</p>

<p>The ruling principle in the majority of these designs has been to
avoid over-ornamentation, and pretentions to display, and to encourage good
solid work, in hard, durable, and (on account of the increased labour)
expensive woods, or, when economy is required, in light soft woods,
painted or enamelled. Some manufacturing firms, whose high reputation
renders them independent of any recommendation, have adopted this
principle, and, as a result, there is now no difficulty in obtaining well
designed and soundly well constructed furniture, which is simple, unpretentious,
and worth the price charged for it. Unfortunately for the
complete success of these sounder principles, really good and appropriate
furniture meets with a fierce competition from more showy and ornate
productions, made to sell rather than to last: furniture which seems to
have upon it the stamp of our "three years' agreement," or "seven years'
lease." Of this it may be said, speaking not only from an artistic, but
from a moral and humane standpoint, it is made so cheaply, that it seems
a pity it is made at all.</p>

<p>A revival in taste, which has been not inappropriately termed "The
New Renaissance," and has produced many excellent results, has been
brought about by several well-known architects and designers. Mr. Street,
R.A.; Messrs. Norman Shaw, R.A.; Waterhouse, R.A.; Sir Alma Tadema,
R.A.; T. G. Jackson, R.A.; W. Burges, R.A.; Walter Crane, Thomas
Cutler, E. W. Godwin, W. Morris, B. J. Talbert, S. Webb, and many
others, have devoted a considerable amount of attention to the design of
furniture; but it is scarcely within the writer's province to attempt a
description of the character of their respective work.</p>

<p>The "Trade" Journals, too, have contributed their influence by
publishing drawings of work completed, suggestions for their readers
to carry out, and also by illustrated notices of the different exhibitions
which take place from time to time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>The "Cabinet Maker and Art Furnisher," edited by Mr. J. Williams
Berm, M.P., L.C.C., contains "Pen and Ink Notes by the Editor," which
should be useful, as they are certainly instructive; and a number of good
designs are published month by month, in "Furniture and Decoration."
These are contributed by J. W. Bliss, R. A. Briggs, A.R.I.B.A., H. L.
Chalmers, Owen W. Davis, Lewis F. Day, Edwin Foley, Christopher
Gill, Bertram Goodhue, Ernest George and Peto, A. Jonquet, Felix
Lenoir, Letharby, Wilbert Rattray, Stenhouse, John Turner, Frank Ward,
A. H. Wolf, and the editors themselves&mdash;Timms and Webb.</p>

<p>In the "American Sketches" published in this Journal, we see the
kind of work which is being designed and carried out in the United
States. Designs of furniture and interior fittings of the houses of
American millionaires, drawn by Cauffmann; Frank Colburn, of Morristown,
New Jersey; Sanford Phipps, and James Thompson, of Boston; Ross and
Marvin, of New York, shew that there is no distinctive American style,
but that the revival in taste, which has been alluded to in England, has
found its way to America, and from the number of articles of furniture
still called after Mr. Eastlake, it is evident that the teachings of that
gentleman had considerable effect. The "Furniture Gazette," "The
Builder," and "Building News" also publish designs of furniture and
woodwork.</p>

<p>The disadvantages, inseparable from our present state of society,
which we have noticed as prejudicial to English design and workmanship,
and which check the production of really satisfactory furniture, are
also to be observed in other countries; and as the English, and
English-speaking people, are probably the largest purchasers of foreign
manufactures, these disadvantages act and re-act on the furniture of
different nations.</p>

<p>In France, the cabinet maker has ever excelled in the production
of ornamental furniture; and by constant reference to older specimens
in the Museums and Palaces of his country, he is far better acquainted
with what may be called the traditions of his craft than his English
brother. To him the styles of François Premier, of Henri Deux, and
the "three Louis" are "classic," and in the beautiful chasing and
finishing of the mounts with which the French <em>bronziste</em> ornaments
the best <em>meubles de luxe</em>, it is almost impossible to surpass his best efforts,
provided the requisite price be paid; but these amounts are, in many
cases, so considerable as hardly to be credible to those who have but
little knowledge of the subject. As a simple instance, the "copy" of
the "Bureau du Louvre" (described in Chapter vi.) in the Hertford House
collection, cost the late Sir Richard Wallace a sum of £4,000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>As, however, in France, and in countries which import French
furniture, there are many who desire to obtain the effect of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
beautiful but expensive furniture, but are unable to spend several thousand
pounds in the decoration of a single room. To meet this demand, the
industrious and ingenious Frenchman manufactures vast quantities of
furniture which affects, without attaining, the merits of the better made
and more highly finished articles.</p>

<p>In Holland, Belgium, and Germany, as has already been pointed
out, the manufacturer of ornamental oak furniture, on the lines of the
Renaissance models, still prevails, and such furniture is largely imported
into this country.</p>

<p>The illustration of a carved frame in the rococo style of Chippendale
with a Chinaman in a canopy, represents an important school of wood-carving
which has been developed in Munich; and in the "Künst
Gewerberein," or "Workman's Exhibition," in that city, the Bavarians
have a very similar arrangement to that of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition
Society of this country, of which mention has already been made, each
article being labelled with the name of the designer and maker.</p>

<p>Italian carved furniture of modern times has already been noticed;
and in the selections made from the 1851 Exhibition, some productions of
different countries have been illustrated, which tend to shew that, speaking
generally, the furniture most suitable for display is produced abroad,
while none can excel English cabinet makers in the production of useful
furniture and woodwork, when it is the result of design and handicraft,
unfettered by the detrimental, but too popular, condition that the article
when finished shall appear to be more costly than it really is.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it seems evident that, with all the faults and
shortcomings of the latter part of the nineteenth century&mdash;and no doubt
they were many, both of commission and of omission&mdash;still, speaking
generally, there was no lack of men with ability to design, and no want of
well trained patient craftsmen to produce, furniture which would equal the
finest examples of the Renaissance and Jacobean periods. With the
improved means of inter-communication between England and her Colonies,
and with the chief industrial centres of Europe united for the purposes
of commerce, the whole civilised world is, as it were, one kingdom:
merchants and manufacturers can select the best and most suitable
materials, can obtain photographs or drawings of the most distant
examples, or copies of the most expensive designs, while the public Art
Libraries of London, and Paris, contain valuable works of reference,
which are easily accessible to the student or to the workman. It is very
pleasant to bear testimony to the courtesy and assistance which the
student or workman invariably receives from those who are in charge of
our public reference libraries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>There needs, however, an important condition to be taken into
account. Good work, requiring educated thought to design, and skilled
labour to produce, must be paid for at a very different rate to the
furniture of machined mouldings, stamped ornament, and other numerous
and inexpensive substitutes for handwork, which our present civilization
has enabled our manufacturers to produce, and which, for the present,
seems to find favour with the multitude. It has been well said that
"Decorated or sumptuous furniture is not merely furniture that is
expensive to buy, but that which has been elaborated with much thought,
knowledge, and skill. Such furniture cannot he cheap certainly, but
<em>the real cost is sometimes borne by the artist who produces, rather than by
the man who may happen to buy it</em>."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> It is often forgotten that the price
paid is that of the lives and health of the workers and their families.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A point has now been reached at which our task must be brought to
its natural conclusion: for although many collectors and others interested
in the subject, have invited the writer's attention to numerous descriptions
and examples, from an examination of which much information could,
without doubt, be obtained, still, the exigencies of a busy life, and the
limits of a single volume of moderate dimensions, forbid the attempt to
add to a story which, it is feared, may perhaps have already overtaxed
the reader's patience.</p>

<p>As has already been suggested in the preface, this book is not intended
to be a guide to "<em>collecting</em>," or "<em>furnishing</em>"; nevertheless, it is possible
that, in the course of recording some of the changes which have taken
place in designs and fashions, and of bringing into notice, here and there,
the opinions of those who have thought and written upon the subject,
some indirect assistance may have been given in both these directions.
If this should be the case, and if an increased interest has been thereby
excited in the surroundings of the Home, or in some of those Art
collections&mdash;the work of by-gone years&mdash;which form part of our National
property, the writer's aim and object will have been attained, and his
humble efforts amply rewarded.</p>

<p>S<span class="smcapa">HISHAM</span> or B<span class="smcapa">LACKWOOD</span> (Dalbergia Sps) is a heavy close-grained wood, dark
brown in color, resembling ebony when polished, and is much used for furniture
in India.</p>

<p>S<span class="smcapa">ANDAL</span> W<span class="smcapa">OOD</span>, T<span class="smcapa">EAK</span>, M<span class="smcapa">ANGO</span> W<span class="smcapa">OOD</span>.&mdash;Sir George Birdwood, in "Indian
Arts," gives a complete list of these Indian woods, with their botanical names
and other valuable information.</p>

<p>For a more complete list of the different woods used by cabinet makers, the
reader is referred to Mr. J. Hungerford Pollen's "Introduction to the South
Kensington Collection"; to many of these he has been able, after much research,
to give their botanical names, a task rendered somewhat difficult owing to the
popular name of the wood being derived from some peculiar marking or colouring
but giving no clue to its botanical status. Amongst these are tulip wood, rose
wood, king wood, pheasant wood, partridge wood, and snake wood. It is worthy
of remark that, whereas in England the terms "king wood" and "tulip wood"
represent the former, a wood of rich dark reddish-brown color, or "purple
madder," and the latter one of a yellowish-red, prettily-streaked, in France these
terms have exactly the reverse equivalents. These were very favourite veneers in
the best French marqueterie furniture described in Chapter VI., and are frequently
found, the one as bordering to relieve the panel or drawer front of the other.</p>

<p>In the Museum at Kew Gardens, and also in the Colonial Galleries of the Imperial
Institute, are excellent collections of many rare woods well worth examination.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><em>Some particulars of the different woods mentioned in the Bible, from which examples
of Ancient Furniture were manufactured, and to which reference has been made
in Chapter I.</em></p>

<p><em>These notes have been kindly supplied by Dr. Edward Clapton, whose collection of
specimens of these scarce woods is of great interest.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>S<span class="smcapa">HITTIM</span> W<span class="smcapa">OOD</span> is the wood of the Shittah tree, or Acacia Seyal. This spiny
tree especially abounded in the peninsula of Sinai and around the Dead Sea, but
was also found in various parts of Syria, Arabia, and Africa. In the present day
the shittah trees are very few and small, but in the time of Moses there were
forests of them, and of a size sufficient to form long and wide planks. It is, as
Jerome says, "a very strong wood of incredible lightness and beauty," and, he
adds, "it is not subject to decay." This corresponds to the translation of the
Hebrew term for shittim wood in the Septuagint, which is "incorruptible wood."
Though light, it is hard, strong, and durable. As a proof of this, the Ark, and
other furniture of the Tabernacle, which were made of shittim wood, must have
lasted for a period of some 500 years before all traces of them were lost. Dean
Stanley remarks that the plural word shittim was given to the wood of the shittah
tree from the tangled thickets into which the stems of the trees expand.</p>

<p>A<span class="smcapa">LMUG</span>.&mdash;The wood of the Pterocarpus Santalinus, a large tree of the order
"Leguminosœ."&mdash;The wood is very hard, has a reddish color, and takes a fine
polish. It is a native of India and Ceylon, whence it was in Solomon's time
conveyed to Ophir, on the east coast of Africa, and from Ophir to Palestine; "and
the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in great plenty of
almug trees, and the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the
Lord, and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries for singers." 1 <em>Kings</em> x.
11, 12. Almug is not the same as Algum, which grew on Lebanon with the cedar
and fir. 2 <em>Chron.</em> ii. 8.</p>

<p>T<span class="smcapa">HYINE</span> W<span class="smcapa">OOD</span>.&mdash;The wood of the Thuja Articulata, now named Callitris
Quadrivalvis, a tree of the cypress sub-order of coniferæ, from 20 to 30 feet high.
It is a native of Algiers and the Atlas range of North Africa. The wood is dark
colored, hard, and fragrant, taking a fine polish; it yields an odoriferous resin
called Sanderach, which was much used by the Romans for incense in the worship
of their gods. Thyine takes its name from "to burn incense." It was much prized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
by the ancient Greeks and Romans, not only because it was considered sacred
but also on account of the beauty of the wood for various ornamental purposes.
Pliny speaks of the mania of his countrymen for ornaments made of this wood, and
tells us that when Roman ladies were upbraided by their husbands for their
extravagance in pearls, they retorted upon them for their excessive fondness for
tables made of thyine wood. So great a rage was there for ornamental cabinet
work in ancient Rome that Cicero had a table made of it that cost £9,000.
Ornaments made of this wood can be seen in the Museum at Kew, presented by
the late Jerome Napoleon. The ceiling and floor of the celebrated Mosque of
Cordova are of thyine wood, and it is also referred to in the Bible.</p>

<h3>TAPESTRY USED FOR FRENCH FURNITURE.</h3>

<p>G<span class="smcapa">OBELINS</span>, B<span class="smcapa">EAUVAIS</span>, <span class="smcapa">AND</span> A<span class="smcapa">UBUSSON</span> T<span class="smcapa">APESTRY</span>.&mdash;The famous factory of
Gobelins originated in the establishment of some dye works in the Faubourg St.
Marcel of Paris, by two brothers, Gilles and Jean Gobelin, who had introduced
from Venice the art of dyeing scarlet; they also produced some other excellent
colors, and this enterprise&mdash;at first considered foolish, and acquiring the name
of <em>Folie Gobelin</em>&mdash;afterwards became most successful. This was in the reign of
François I.; they subsequently added a tapestry factory to their dye works.
Either in 1662 or in 1667, as different authorities state, Colbert, who had succeeded
Cardinal Mazarin as Chief Adviser and Minister of Louis XIV., purchased the
factory from the Gobelin family, and reorganised the establishment as the Royal
Upholstery Works, employing the artists Lebrun, Berain, Simon Vouet, and
others, to furnish subjects for the cartoons, the former artist being appointed
Director of the Works. Since 1697 the manufacture of tapestry only has been
carried on, and the product of these celebrated looms has become known as
Gobelins tapestry. Previous to this time, however, namely, 1669, Colbert ordered
the manufacture at Gobelins of what is termed the "low warp" tapestry suitable
for furniture&mdash;a branch of manufacture which had been transferred to the State
works of Beauvais, where the special mode of making tapestry, suitable for the
covering of chairs and sofas, has since been carried on, the looms of Gobelins
being more generally employed to produce larger panels for hangings. The fine
texture, the brilliant colorings of the famous tapestry, are world famous; and
enormous sums are commanded by some of the older panels, the tints of which
are softened by age, while the condition remains good. Besides the tapestry for
furniture, sometimes made at Gobelins, and more generally at Beauvais, a great
deal has been produced by the looms at Aubusson, a factory said to have been
originated by the immigration of some Flemish workmen into La March during
the fourteenth century. Owing, however, to the difficulty in obtaining good patterns
and the quality of wool required, their tapestry did not acquire a very high
reputation. Colbert granted these manufactories a Charter in 1669, and also gave
them protection against foreign rivals; and the looms of Aubusson became busy
and their proprietors prosperous. The productions of Gobelins and Beauvais being
monopolised by the Court, the works of Aubusson had to provide for the more
general requirements of the people, and, therefore, though good of its kind, and
occasionally excellent, this tapestry has never attained the reputation of its
more famous contemporaries. To those who would learn more of Tapestry, its
history, methods of production, and many instructive details, the little South
Kensington handbook, "Tapestry," is highly commended; it was written for the
Science and Art Department by M. Alfred de Champeaux, and translated by
Mrs. R. F. Sketchley.</p>

<h3>THE PROCESSES OF GILDING AND POLISHING.</h3>

<p>W<span class="smcapa">OOD</span> G<span class="smcapa">ILDING</span>.&mdash;The processes of applying gold to wood and to metal are
entirely different. In the former the gold, which has been supplied to the gilder in
extremely thin layers, generally placed between the leaves of a little paper book to
prevent them sticking together, is transferred therefrom to the surface to be gilt, by
a dexterous movement of a flat gilder's camel's hair brush, or "tip," as it is termed,
the wood having been previously prepared by successive coatings of whitening
and thin glue, a thicker body of preparations being required for those parts which
are to be burnished. A great deal depends upon the care and time bestowed
on the preparation of the work, sometimes as many as ten coatings being given
to the wood, and these are successively rubbed down with pumice stone and glass
paper, care being taken not to lose the sharpness of carved ornaments. This
application of gold leaf is termed mechanical gilding, and is used for gilt furniture,
picture frames, or other decorations. Within the last ten years the gold has
been applied to the more richly carved furniture in a powder. This preparation
of gold is very expensive, costing about £7 the ounce, and is only used for
the more costly chairs and couches, etc., generally of old French make, which
require re-gilding.</p>

<p>M<span class="smcapa">ETAL</span> G<span class="smcapa">ILDING</span>.&mdash;The process of gilding metal which was practised by the
mounters of the fine old French furniture described in Chapter VI., consisted in
applying to the "ormolu" an amalgam of gold and mercury; the latter was
evaporated by heat, and the gold remained firmly adhered to the metal mount,
and was afterwards colored as desired, a slightly greenish tinge being effected by
such masters as Caffieri, Gouthière, and others. This kind of gilding requires a
considerable quantity of the precious metal to be used, and is therefore very costly,
but is rich in effect, and, under favourable conditions, permanent. It is, however,
very injurious to the workers, on account of the fumes of the mercury poisoning the
system; and it has generally been abandoned in favour of the much quicker and
far cheaper process of electro-gilding, by which an effect can be produced by an
infinitesimal coating of gold. The water gilding process is still used to a moderate
extent by the makers of the more expensive reproductions of old furniture in
Paris. There is a very cheap and effective process of lacquering which sometimes is
termed "gilding," used to give ormolu mounts the color of gold; this is done by
applying a solution of shellac and spirits of wine to the metal when heated, and,
as with water-gilding, the volatile spirit evaporates and leaves a thin coating of
the shellac, which may also be treated so as to have very much the appearance of
gold, to the inexperienced eye. It should be mentioned that where mounts are
gilt, it is usual to make the material more like the color of gold than ordinary
brass would be; this is done by the admixture of a considerable amount of copper,
the amalgam being generally termed "or-molu."</p>

<p>P<span class="smcapa">OLISHING</span>.&mdash;The older method of polishing woodwork consisted in the
application of a mixture of turpentine and beeswax to the surface; this would be
repeated again and again, and then well rubbed down with a hard brush, when a
very durable polish was obtained. For flat surfaces, and particularly for the tops
of dining tables which were formerly uncovered to show the wood, oil polishing
was the fashion; this was effected by rubbing the table-top with a heavy weight
backwards and forwards, using oil as a lubricant. Good housewives used to
polish up their dining tables very frequently. Oil polishing had the great
advantage, too, of producing a surface which hot plates did not easily mark. The
cost, time, and trouble, however, caused these older processes to be abandoned in
favour of "French" polishing, which is the application on a prepared surface
of shellac dissolved in methylated spirits, and often other ingredients to give
poor-looking wood a richer color. This polish is quicker, and therefore, cheaper
than the old-fashioned method. It has come into general adoption since the Great
Exhibition of 1851.</p>

<h3>THE PIANOFORTE.</h3>

<p>The Pianoforte is such an important article in the furniture of the present time,
that a few notes about its development, from a decorative point of view,
may be acceptable. In "Musical Instruments," one of the South Kensington
handbooks, Carl Engel traces the Pianoforte from the "Clavicembalo," which he
tells us, "was, in fact, nothing but a Cembalo or Dulcimer, with a key board
attached to it." Our present Grand Piano was, however, more immediately a
development of the Harpsichord<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> and Spinet, which had succeeded the Virginal
of the 16th century. These were made of oblong shape and supported on stands,
which were simply supports for the instrument, and did not form a part of it as do
the legs of a modern "grand." In an original play bill, which is still preserved
at Messrs. Broadwoods', there is an announcement that at the Theatre Royal,
Covent Garden, on the 16th of May, 1767, at the end of Act I. (of the Beggars'
Opera), "Miss Brickler will sing a favourite song from 'Judith,' accompanied by
Mr. Dibden, on <em>a new Instrument, called Pianoforte</em>."</p>

<p>There is an illustration on p. <a href="#Page_172">172</a> of a Harpsichord which is in the South
Kensington Museum, and in the same collection are others, varying in types as
instruments, and of different decorations. The one which belonged to Handel is a
good specimen of the decoration bestowed on these instruments. Others of about
the middle of the eighteenth century, were covered with a coating of lacquer,
like some of the furniture referred to in Chapter VI., the parts of the cases to be so
decorated having been sent to China, and returned when coated with the
preparation, then only known to the Chinese, but afterwards imitated in Europe.
Some of these lacquered cases are very beautiful, and those which were elaborately
painted in the Vernis Martin style, are finished with the care of cabinet pictures
or miniatures. They have, as a rule, the fine subject painting, or landscape, inside
the lid of the case, as in the illustration on p. <a href="#Page_172">172</a>, while the outside of the case is
decorated with arabesques of gold on a dark colored ground. Such an Instrument
was sold at the sale of Lord Lonsdale's furniture, a few years ago, for some three
hundred pounds.</p>

<p>The rectangular shape appears to have been partially abandoned for the
"Wing form," of which the modern "Grand" is a development, about the time of
Queen Anne, and was, in some cases, adapted to the Harpsichord of the time.
The earlier pianofortes were rectangular in form, with the idea of preventing the
unequal appearance produced by the bent treble side of the Grand, and the writer
has in his possession such an instrument, without pedals, which bears the
inscription:&mdash;"By Royal Patent. Longman and Broderip, Musical Instrument
makers, 13, Haymarket, and 26, Cheapside, London." Collard and Collard are
the successors of this firm, and still retain the same premises in Cheapside. The
oldest Broadwood <em>piano</em>, at present on exhibition in Vienna, bears the name of
"Schudi and Broadwood," with date 1780. It is square and without pedals.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the last century pianos were made to harmonize with the
Adam, Hepplewhite, and Sheraton furniture of the day, and some were elaborately
inlaid with small plaques of Wedgwood's Jasper ware.</p>

<p>There are also instruments in existence, and designs, which shew that as the
style of furniture changed during the time of the French Revolution, and subsequently
to the Classic Greek, the Piano followed the new fashion. There is in St.
James's Palace the instrument made by Broadwood for the Princess Charlotte,
who died early in the nineteenth century. This is square in form, and is veneered
with a single sheet of ivory, the elephant's tusk having been first softened by
acid, and then cut circular fashion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>In France, the older Harpsichord and the later Pianoforte have followed the
different styles which have affected the decorative furniture of that country, and
the same remark applies to the more limited productions of such instruments in
other countries.</p>

<p>During the period of had taste which prevailed in England thirty or forty
years ago, those who made and those who purchased pianos were content to have
either the instrument in the most ordinary and commonplace case of mahogany,
walnut, or the rosewood which about 1840 came into great favour, or else the
cases were designed in an extravagant fashion, and covered with a superabundance
of ornament, quite out of keeping with the use of a musical
instrument.</p>

<p>Two illustrations in Chapter IX., one of Broadwood's Grand, and the other
of an upright in Bottle's style of work, by Leistler, of Vienna, may be taken as
the most favourable examples of pinaoforte decorations at the time of the 1851
Exhibition.</p>

<p>Latterly there has been amongst leading manufacturers, especially those of
our own country, a marked improvement, and the cases are made of rare and
carefully chosen woods, and the style adapted, in many instances to the furniture
of the room. Sir Alma Tadema designed cases in the Byzantine style. Mr.
Burne-Jones painted one with an elaborate design of figures and scrolls; another
with a shower of roses right across the sounding board, and he also revived the
old-fashioned trestle support, formerly used for harpsichords. Mr. Waterhouse,
R.A., Mr. John Birnie Philip, who executed the podium of the Albert Memorial,
Mr. T. G. Jackson, R.A., and others, have also designed piano cases for friends
and clients.</p>

<p>In the "Inventions" Exhibition, a few years since, there was a very good
opportunity of noticing the advance in design of the Pianoforte. In nearly every
instance the old fashioned fretwork front had been abandoned for a painting or a
marquetry panel. Some were enamelled white, and relieved by gilding; others
had a kind of gesso-work decoration, and the different fashionable styles of
furniture were reproduced with various modifications. Amongst others, Kirkmans
exhibited a grand and an upright made from designs by Col. Edis, and Hopkinson
a boudoir grand and some small cottage pianos in satinwood and marquetry, and
also in satinwood painted in the old English style, and having silk panels in front
with copies of Bartolozzi prints. The designs were in the latter case made by the
author. Broadwoods, and other English firms, also produced special designs.</p>

<p>Since this Exhibition, if there has not been improvement, there has been
endless variety, and the piano case is now designed and decorated to please the
taste of the most fastidious or the most eccentric.</p>

Monastery suppressed by Joseph II.) are famous examples of early intarsia. In an essay on the
subject written by Mr. T. G. Jackson, A.R.A., they are said to be the work of one Bartolommeo, an
Istrian artist, and to date from 1486. The same writer mentions still more elaborate examples of
pictorial "intarsia" in the choir stalls of Sta. Maria, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Maggoire'">Maggiore</ins>, in Bergamo.</p></div>

the French Renaissance, as contrasted with the Italian, is that in the latter the details and
ornament of the new school were imposed on the old foundations of the Gothic character. The
Chateau of Chambord is given as an instance of this combination.</p></div>
